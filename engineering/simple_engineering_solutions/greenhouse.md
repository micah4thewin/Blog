## Introduction to Greenhouses
A greenhouse (or hothouse) is a structure designed to create an environment to grow and maintain plants. It is usually built from glass, plastic film, or metal frames and is covered with a covering material that helps to maintain the desired temperature and humidity that the plants inside require. Greenhouses are widely used for growing crops, flowers, and vegetables year-round, and the technology inside each greenhouse varies greatly depending on the purpose for which it's used. 

## Benefits of Greenhouses
Greenhouses provide numerous benefits when it comes to growing plants. First of all, greenhouses allow plants to mature quicker in a controlled environment and they also protect plants from various pest and environmental impacts. Additionally, as the temperature inside the greenhouse is not subject to the outdoor temperature fluctuations, plants grown inside a greenhouse can remain at a constant, optimal temperature all year long, enabling them to get higher yields and a greater lifespan. Finally, greenhouses create a highly-controlled growing environment, allowing for ideal light exposure, as well as controlled water and nutrient delivery to the plant.

## Types of Greenhouses
There are many different types of greenhouses available, each of which is suited to different growing conditions. 

### Glass Greenhouses
Glass greenhouses are the most traditional type of greenhouses and offer the best insulation from outside temperatures. Glass greenhouses enable maximum levels of natural sunlight and also provide the best protection from strong winds or storms. Their downside is that they require a lot of maintenance and are more expensive to build. 

### Polyethylene Film Greenhouses
Polyethylene film greenhouses are the most common type of greenhouses and are usually built by stretching a polyethylene film (typically clear plastic) over the metal or wooden frame. They are cheaper and easier to construct than glass greenhouses, but provide a lower level of insulation, as plastic films are not as resistant to temperature fluctuations as glass. They are also less durable than glass greenhouses and require more frequent maintenance.

### Tents
Tents are portable, semi-transparent structures that can be erected quickly and taken down easily due to their lightweight frames. They're usually composed of reinforced fabric with reinforced seams for protection from the elements. While they aren't suitable for permanent growing sites, they can be used for short-term growing whenever there is a need.

### Green Walls/Vertical Gardens
Green walls are another type of temporary greenhouse, designed for vertical gardens. Green walls are formed with a combination of vertical posts and metal or wooden frames which are covered with a flexible plastic film to create the desired environment. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, making them suitable for both small and large growing areas.

## Building/Maintaining a Greenhouse
Building and maintaining a greenhouse requires careful planning and consideration of the plants that will be grown within it. 

### Specifications
Before building a greenhouse, it's important to determine the purpose of the structure and some general specifications. Considerations such as the size, shape, and type of materials to be used in the construction should be considered. Additionally, the amount of light, temperature, and humidity that are required should be determined so that the structure can be designed to meet those requirements. 

### Construction
Once the greenhouse has been clesigned, the building process begins. It's important to ensure that all necessary materials are on hand, such as framing materials, covering material, and any other necessary components. Additionally, the foundation and any other structure that will house or support the greenhouse (such as a deck or patio) should be built first before the greenhouse frame and covering are assembled. 

### Installation
When the frame of the greenhouse is complete, the covering material (typically glass or plastic) can be installed. It's important to be sure the covering is tightly secured to keep the environment sealed and free from outside pollutants. Additionally, any vents or fans that need to be installed can be done so at this time. 

### Maintenance
Regular maintenance is key to keeping a greenhouse healthy and productive. The plants within the greenhouse should be checked periodically for health and any necessary changes should be made. If the environment is not suitable for the specific plants being grown, modifications should be made in order to ensure that the plants are getting the correct levels of light, temperature, and humidity. Additionally, the covering material should be checked for tears or leaks, as well as any other signs of damage. 

## Conclusion
Greenhouses can be a great way to grow plants throughout the year, regardless of the outdoor climate. Greenhouses provide a controlled environment to ensure that plants receive the necessary levels of light, temperature, and humidity they need in order to thrive. There are a variety of different types of greenhouses available, which can be constructed to suit any environmental requirements. In order to ensure the longevity and success of the greenhouse, proper planning, building, and maintenance are vital.
