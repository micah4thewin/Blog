## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Earthships are a type of sustainable home that are designed to operate independently from public utilities by employing a combination of modern off-grid technology and age-old building techniques. They use passive solar heating and cooling, rainwater collection, solar and wind electricity, and even food production to create a self-sustained living environment. Earthships are constructed using natural and recycled materials, like earth-packed tires, making them a low-impact and environmentally friendly housing solution.

## History <a name="history"></a>

Earthships were developed in the 1970s by architect Michael Reynolds in response to the energy crisis. The concept was to create a home that would do "three things": firstly, to utilize sustainable architecture, and not rely on independent utilities and fossil fuels; secondly, to be constructed using recycled materials indigenous to the entire planet; thirdly, to be able to be produced independently by the average person. Over time, the design has evolved to improve comfort and efficiency, but the core principles remain the same.

## Concept <a name="concept"></a>

The Earthship design concept is to create a home that is in harmony with the planet. They are constructed using natural and recycled materials, and are designed to operate independently from public utilities. This includes generating their own electricity, harvesting their own water, managing their own waste, and even producing their own food.

## Scientific and Engineering Concepts <a name="scientific-and-engineering-concepts"></a>

Earthships incorporate several scientific and engineering concepts. They utilize thermal mass to regulate indoor temperatures, photovoltaic and wind systems for electricity, rainwater catchment systems for water, and on-site wastewater treatment. The design is also oriented for optimal sun exposure for passive solar heating and cooling, and for photovoltaic efficiency.

## Materials <a name="materials"></a>

* **Tires:** The primary construction material for Earthships. Old car or truck tires are filled with compacted earth, creating a solid, dense block that forms the bearing walls of the structure. The thermal mass properties of the tire walls help regulate indoor temperature by storing heat during the day and slowly releasing it at night.

* **Cans & Bottles:** Aluminum cans and glass bottles serve as secondary building materials. They are used as infill in non-load bearing walls, often in combination with concrete or adobe. This reduces the amount of concrete needed, and the bottles can be arranged to create decorative, light-allowing patterns in the walls.

* **Earth:** Local earth can be used both as the fill for the tires and to create an adobe or cob mixture for plastering the walls, providing a natural, breathable finish. The specific mix of sand, clay, and straw can be adjusted to suit the local soil conditions and climate.

* **Solar Panels & Wind Turbines:** To enable off-grid living, Earthships incorporate renewable energy systems. Solar panels are typically the main source of electricity, complemented by wind turbines in areas with sufficient wind. These systems charge a battery bank that provides a stable, 24/7 power supply.

* **Rainwater Collection Systems:** Earthships are designed to be self-sufficient in water by capturing rainwater and snowmelt. The roof is designed to channel water into a cistern, from where it is filtered and pumped to the taps.

* **Greywater & Blackwater Treatment Systems:** All wastewater generated in the Earthship is treated and reused on-site. Greywater from sinks and showers is typically used to irrigate indoor planters. Blackwater from the toilet goes to a conventional septic tank, and the overflow is used to irrigate non-edible plants outdoors.

## Steps for Earthship Construction <a name="steps-for-earthship-construction"></a>

1. **Planning:** Start with a detailed plan that includes the building design, materials, available resources, local climate conditions, and regulatory environment. Earthship construction can be a complex process, so thorough planning is essential.

2. **Ground Preparation:** Clear and level the ground at the building site. Mark out the building dimensions and layout using stakes and string.

3. **Tire Walls:** Fill the tires with earth and compact it using a sledgehammer. Once filled, the tires are stacked in a staggered pattern to form the load-bearing walls. Each layer of tires is offset from the previous one, similar to traditional brickwork.

4. **Internal Walls & Vaults:** Construct the non-load bearing walls using a combination of cans or bottles with cement. These walls can be used to divide the interior space, and because they don't support the structure, you can be more creative with their placement and shape.

5. **Roof Construction:** Construct a roof suitable for rainwater catchment. This is typically a sloping roof that channels water into a gutter system, but the exact design can vary based on the climate and aesthetic preferences.

6. **Water & Power Systems:** Install the systems for water collection, filtration, and storage, as well as the solar and wind power systems. This will involve setting up the cistern, pumps, filters, solar panels, wind turbines, and battery bank.

7. **Plastering & Finishing:** The final step is to plaster the walls and finish the interior. The plaster can be a mud-based mixture or cement, depending on your preference and the local climate. Once the plaster is dry, you can install windows and doors, paint, add fixtures, and complete any other finishing touches.

## Pro Tips <a name="pro-tips"></a>

* **Understand local regulations:** Earthships are not permitted in all regions. Make sure to check with your local building codes and regulations before starting the project.

* **Get professional help:** If you're new to building or the Earthship concept, consider hiring professionals or attend an Earthship Academy. These specialized training programs can provide you with hands-on experience and guidance on building your own Earthship.

* **Maintenance:** While Earthships are designed to be low maintenance, they still require some upkeep. Regularly check and maintain your renewable energy systems, water filtration systems, and the structure of the Earthship to ensure it stays in good condition.


## Problems Solved by Earthships <a name="problems-solved-by-earthships"></a>

* **Sustainability:** Earthships provide a means of living that minimizes impact on the environment.
* **Independence:** Earthships allow for off-grid living, providing their own power, water, and often food.
* **Resilience:** Earthships are often resistant to natural disasters, including earthquakes and storms.
