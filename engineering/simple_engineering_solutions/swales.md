# Introduction to Swales

Swales are simple structures designed to capture, store, and/or divert stormwater runoff. Made up of shallow basins or gentle slopes, they are filled and lined with natural materials like gravel and grasses to help slow water flow and provide a surface for water to percolate into the ground. Often wetter environments such as creeks, wetlands, or ponds are located downstream to capture additional runoff and provide a nature resource benefit. Swales provide a more pleasing, natural landscape alternative to traditional storm water management structures such as concrete gutters or retention ponds.

## Planning Your Swale

Before starting your swale, you should plan the project carefully to make sure it will be effective and safe. Here are a few key considerations when planning your swale:

* Determine the location of your swale. Make sure it is in an area that is natural and can easily be maintained. It should also be away from any wells or other areas where runoff can contaminate drinking water.

* Locate the source of water for your swale. Make sure that there is an adequate source of water, such as rainfall, runoff from nearby buildings, or nearby streams.

* Determine the size and shape of the swale. For maximum effectiveness, your swale should have a shallow slope (2-4%) and a wide basin (3-5 feet). Additionally, the swale should be long enough to capture and store or divert runoff from its source.

* Pick the right plants. Native vegetation or grass is generally best because it helps to absorb and filter runoff, as well as stabilize the soil.

## Building Your Swale

Now that you have decided on a design, it is time to build the swale. Here are some steps to guide you from start to finish:

1. Stake out the area. Using stakes and string, outline the shape and size of your swale. Make sure it is wide enough to store or divert water.
 
2. Remove the topsoil. Using a shovel or tiller, remove the top layer of soil from the area (at least 6 inches deep). If you are reusing this soil to build the swale, make sure to pile it off to the side and ensure that it is not contaminated.

3. Level the swale. Once you have removed the topsoil, use stakes and string to level the area. Make sure the area is fairly level (ideally, 2-4% slope).

4. Line the swale with materials. Line the swale with materials like gravel or clay to keep water from eroding the soil and to help move the water across the length of the swale.

5. Plant vegetation. Plant vegetation, like grass, to further slow water flow and absorb and filter runoff. Make sure to choose non-invasive plant species, if possible.

6. Monitor the swale. Monitor the swale regularly for signs of erosion, clogged vegetation, or debris.

## Maintaining Your Swale

Once the swale is built, it is important to maintain it to ensure it is effective for storm water runoff. Here are some tips for maintenance:

* Monitor the swale regularly for signs of erosion or clogged vegetation.

* Remove any debris that accumulates in the swale.

* Prune the vegetation to keep it healthy and growing.

* Remove any weeds or invasive plants that may try to take over the swale.

* Apply fertilizers or additional amendments to promote healthy growth of vegetation.

* Repair any erosion or damaged areas of the swale.

By following these steps, you can ensure your swale is effective and can provide valuable ecosystem benefits for many years to come.
