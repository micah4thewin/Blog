# Introduction to a Tippy Tap
A tippy tap is a simple, low-cost and hygienic device used for hand-washing. It uses very little water, requires no electricity or plumbing, and is appropriate for a wide range of environments, from rural villages to refugee camps. In this guide, we look at what a tippy tap is, its advantages and disadvantages, how to build one, and how to maintain and operate it. 

# What is a Tippy Tap? 
A tippy tap is a hand-washing device consisting of a container usually made of plastic, metal or wood, suspended from a support or stand. Attached to the container is a lever – usually a string or stick – that is used to tilt the container and release water. Often, the container is filled with a mixture of water and detergent to allow for more effective hand-washing. 

# Advantages of a Tippy Tap
The main advantage of a tippy tap is its low cost and simplicity. It does not require electricity or any plumbing and is very easy to build and maintain. Tippy taps can also be used in a wide range of environments from rural villages to crowded refugee camps. Tippy taps are also much more hygienic than other methods because they use a minimum amount of water and are designed to prevent contamination. Because the user of a tippy tap stands up and takes a few steps away while the container is tilted, the risk of contamination from the surface is minimized. Finally, this design is helpful in water-scarce regions because it uses only a small amount of water. 

# Disadvantages of a Tippy Tap
The main disadvantage of a tippy tap is that it can be somewhat inconvenient to use. The process of tilting the container can be slow and prone to accidental spills. Also, as one person is washing their hands someone else has to stand holding the tippy tap in the correct position for the duration. Finally, as with any other hand-washing device, it requires people to learn how to properly use it, and for young children this can be difficult. 

# How to Build a Tippy Tap
Building a tippy tap is a fairly simple process that can be completed in a few relatively easy steps.

### Step 1: Gather Materials 
First, gather the necessary materials which include: 
- Container – this can be a tin can, plastic bottle, plastic bag, bucket, or wooden box
- String or stick – to work as the lever
- Nails, screws, or bolts – to secure the tippy tap to the support
- Support – something to suspend and anchor the tippy tap in position. This can be anything from a hoop of twigs to a specially designed stand, depending on the environment. 

### Step 2: Build the Container 
There are many different ways to build the container depending on which materials have been gathered.

- For a plastic bottle, cut a small hole at the bottom and attach a lid or stopper.
- For a tin can, cut a hole at the bottom and attach a lid or stopper.
- For a wooden box, attach a lid at the top and cut a small hole at the bottom.

### Step 3: Attach Lever 
The lever is usually a string or stick that is tied or attached to the container. The length of the lever is determined by how much space is available and how far away the user has to stand from the tippy tap.

### Step 4: Attach to Support
To attach the tippy tap to the support, use the nails, screws, or bolts. Make sure the tippy tap is secure and can tilt in all directions without coming off.

### Step 5: Fill with Water
For optimum hygiene, fill the container with a mixture of both water and detergent. 

### Step 6: Use
To use the tippy tap, stand a few steps away, and pull on the lever to tilt the container. Once the water is released, rub your hands together until they feel clean. 

# How to Maintain and Operate a Tippy Tap

### Maintaining the Tippy Tap
Maintaining a tippy tap is easy and requires only a few steps.

- Empty the container— Ideally, the container should be emptied a few times a day. This should be done by tilting the container until it is completely empty and then refilling it.
- Check for damages – Inspect the tippy tap for any damages such as leaks or broken pieces.
- Clean the container – Make sure to wipe down the inside of the container with soap and water periodically to keep it clean.

### Operating the Tippy Tap
To operate a tippy tap, stand a few steps away and pull on the lever to tilt the container. Once the water is released, rub your hands together until they feel clean. Make sure to refill the container periodically to ensure a steady flow of water. 

# Conclusion
A tippy tap is a simple, low-cost and hygienic device used for hand-washing. It is easy to build, maintain and operate and requires no electricity or plumbing. Tippy taps are useful in a wide range of environments from rural villages to refugee camps. This simple device can be a valuable tool for improving a person's health and well-being, making it an important part of any hygiene program.
