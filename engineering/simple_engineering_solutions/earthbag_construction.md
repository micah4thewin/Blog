# Earthbag Construction Guide

Earthbag construction is an inexpensive and sustainable building method that uses mostly local soil to create structures that are strong and durable. Earthbag buildings can be used for various purposes, such as homes, offices, shops, schools, shelters, and more. Earthbag buildings can also be adapted to different climates and environments, such as flood-prone areas, earthquake zones, or cold regions.

## Benefits of Earthbag Construction

Some of the benefits of earthbag construction are:

- It is low-cost and uses readily available materials, such as soil, sand, gravel, or crushed rock.
- It is environmentally friendly and reduces the need for cement, wood, or metal.
- It is flexible and versatile and can create various shapes and designs, such as curved walls, domes, vaults, or arches.
- It is resilient and resistant to fire, water, wind, pests, and bullets.
- It is easy and fun to learn and can be done by anyone with basic skills and tools.

## Tools and Materials for Earthbag Construction

The main tools and materials for earthbag construction are:

- Woven polypropylene bags (about 18" x 30") or tubes (about 18" wide)
- Barbed wire (4-point) or other reinforcement materials
- Soil or fill material (preferably moist subsoil with some clay content)
- Buckets or chutes for filling the bags
- Tampers for compacting the bags
- Stringline and corner guides for aligning the bags
- Knife and wire cutters for cutting the bags and wire
- Hammer and chisel or bolt cutters for cutting the barbed wire
- Tape measure and level for checking the dimensions and levelness of the walls
- Sheetmetal slider or plastic sheet for sliding the bags into place
- Galvanized wire or twine for sewing or tying the bags closed
- Plaster or stucco for finishing the walls

## Steps for Earthbag Construction

The following steps describe the basic process of building vertical earthbag walls. For more details and variations, you can refer to various books, websites, videos, or courses on earthbag building.

1. Prepare the site: Clear and level the site, remove topsoil, dig a trench to stable subsoil (about 12" deep), fill the trench with gravel (about 12" thick), and mark the corners and outline of the building with stakes and stringline.
2. Fill the bags: Use buckets or chutes to fill the bags with soil or fill material. Use the same number of buckets for each bag to ensure uniform size. Fill the bags about 90% full, leaving enough space to sew or tie them closed.
3. Lay the bags: Start from a corner and lay the bags in courses along the stringline. Stagger the joints like bricklaying and overlap the corners. Use a sheetmetal slider or plastic sheet to slide the bags into place without spilling the contents. Sew or tie the bags closed with wire or twine.
4. Compact the bags: Use tampers to compact each bag after laying it. Tamp all sides and corners until the bag is firm and flat. Make sure each course is level before starting the next one.
5. Reinforce the bags: Place a strand of barbed wire between each course of bags to increase friction and tensile strength. Use a hammer and chisel or bolt cutters to cut the wire to length. Use gloves to handle the wire carefully. You can also use other reinforcement materials, such as bamboo, rebar, mesh, or rope.
6. Shape the bags: Use your hands or tools to shape the bags as you go. You can create curves, angles, openings, niches, or other features by adjusting the placement and orientation of the bags. You can also use temporary forms or molds to shape domes, vaults, arches, or windows.
7. Finish the walls: After completing the walls, you can apply plaster or stucco to protect them from weathering and UV damage. You can use cement-based or natural-based plasters depending on your preference and availability. You can also add color or texture to your plaster to create different effects.
8. Add roof and other elements: Depending on your design and needs, you can add a roof and other elements to your earthbag building. You can use conventional roofs (such as metal, tile, shingle) or natural roofs (such as thatch, green roof) depending on your budget and climate. You can also add doors, windows, floors, insulation, plumbing,
electricity, ventilation, heating, cooling etc.

## Engineering Principles of Earthbag Construction

Earthbag construction is based on some engineering principles that ensure its strength and stability. Some of these principles are:

- **Internal stability**: The fill material inside the bags should have enough cohesion and friction to resist deformation under load. Moist subsoil with some clay content is ideal for this purpose.
- **External stability**: The walls should have enough mass and thickness to resist overturning forces from wind or earthquake. The walls should also have enough bracing from intersecting walls or buttresses to prevent buckling.
- **Reinforcement**: The walls should have enough reinforcement from barbed wire or other materials to increase tensile strength and ductility. The reinforcement should also be well connected to bond beams, foundations, and roofs to create a continuous load path.
- **Shape**: The walls should have a shape that enhances their structural performance. Curved walls are more stable than straight walls because they distribute loads evenly and resist shear forces. Domes are more stable than flat roofs because they act as arches in all directions.

## Pro Tips for Earthbag Construction

Here are some pro tips that can help you improve your earthbag construction skills:

- Use good quality bags that are strong, UV-resistant, and biodegradable. Avoid using recycled bags that may have holes, tears, or stains.
- Use moist soil that has enough clay content (about 10% - 30%) to bind together when tamped. Avoid using dry, sandy, or organic soil that may settle, shrink, or decompose over time.
- Use a bucket chute or a funnel to fill the bags quickly and evenly. Avoid overfilling or underfilling the bags as this may cause unevenness or instability in the walls.
- Use a sheetmetal slider or a plastic sheet to slide the bags into place without spilling the contents. Avoid dragging or lifting the bags as this may damage the bags or disturb the alignment of the walls.
- Use a tamper with a flat base and a long handle to compact the bags firmly and evenly. Avoid using a tamper with a round base or a short handle as this may cause unevenness or fatigue in tamping.
- Use gloves when handling barbed wire to prevent injuries. Use a hammer and chisel or bolt cutters to cut the wire cleanly and accurately. Avoid using scissors or pliers as this may cause fraying or twisting of the wire.
- Use galvanized wire or twine to sew or tie the bags closed securely. Use a needle with a large eyelet and a sharp point to pierce through the bag easily. Avoid using staples or nails as this may puncture the bag unnecessarily.

## History of Earthbag Construction

Earthbag construction has a long history that dates back thousands of years ago. Some of its historical roots are:

- **Rammed earth construction**: This is an ancient technique of building walls by compacting moist soil inside wooden forms. Rammed earth structures are still standing today in many parts of the world, such as China, Spain, and Morocco. Some call earthbag construction "rammed earth in a bag" or "reinforced rammed earth".
- **Military bunker construction**: This is a modern technique of building defensive structures by filling sandbags with soil and stacking them in layers. Sandbags were first used in warfare during World War I and have been used ever since in various conflicts around the world, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. Some call earthbag construction "superadobe" or "sandbag architecture".
- **Flood-control dike construction**: This is a practical technique of building temporary barriers by filling polypropylene bags with sand or gravel and placing them along riverbanks or coastlines. Polypropylene bags were first used for flood control during Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and have been used widely since then in various disasters around the world, such as Hurricane Katrina, Tsunami 2004, and Pakistan Floods 2010.

## Science Concepts behind Earthbag Construction

Earthbag construction involves some science concepts that explain how it works and why it is effective. Some of these concepts are:

- **Soil mechanics**: This is a branch of engineering that studies how soil behaves under different conditions of stress, strain, moisture, and temperature. Soil mechanics helps us understand how different types of soil affect earthbag construction, such as clay, sand, gravel, or rock. Soil mechanics also helps us design foundations, drainage systems, and slope stabilization for earthbag structures.
- **Structural engineering**: This is a branch of engineering that studies how structures withstand various forces and loads, such as gravity, wind, earthquake, or snow. Structural engineering helps us design and analyze earthbag structures, such as walls, domes, vaults, or arches. Structural engineering also helps us choose appropriate reinforcement materials, such as barbed wire, bamboo, rebar, or mesh.
- **Physics**: This is a branch of science that studies the nature and behavior of matter and energy, such as motion, force, pressure,
heat,
sound,
light,
or electricity.
Physics helps us understand how earthbag structures interact with their environment,
such as temperature changes,
moisture levels,
sound transmission,
or thermal insulation.
Physics also helps us calculate
the energy efficiency
and environmental impact
of earthbag structures.
