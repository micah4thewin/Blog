# Introduction to Windbreaks
A windbreak is an effective way to reduce wind speed and increase the amount of sheltered space in a variety of different settings, whether it be for agriculture, out of doors activities, or even for your own backyard. This comprehensive guide will give you a comprehensive overview of what a windbreak is, why it is needed, and how to best go about creating one. 

# What is a Windbreak?
A windbreak is a barrier of trees, shrubs, and other plants that are normally planted in an arrangement to slow down and redirect wind, increase shelter from the rain, reduce erosion, and provide a habitat for wildlife. Windbreaks are also capable of altering the climate in an area; they can reduce air temperatures, reduce snow and wind drift, and increase humidity.

# Why Create a Windbreak?
There are many benefits to creating a windbreak, which is why they are so popular for many different types of uses. 

1. **Protection of Crops and Animals:** Windbreaks are an effective way of protecting crops, livestock, and pets from harsh winds. Windbreaks, when arranged strategically in a certain orientation, can block and deflect wind over a greater area, providing a more sheltered and safer environment for plants and animals.  
2. **Reduced Soil Erosion:** Windbreaks can reduce soil erosion caused by high winds. They slow down wind velocity, which reduces soil and sediment loss due to the wind. 
3. **Reduced Air Temperature:** Windbreaks are able to reduce the air temperature of an area by blocking wind, thus reducing the speed of evaporation. They also reduce the amount of drying and heat transfer due to wind. 
4. **Improved Agriculture:** Windbreaks can improve the yield of crops, especially those of a shorter stature. The windbreaks shield the crops from being stunted and broken by strong winds, allowing them to grow healthier and faster. 
5. **Provides Habitat:** Windbreaks can also provide a habitat for wildlife and the shelter and security that small animals and birds need. 

# How to Create a Windbreak
Creating a windbreak involves a number of decisions to be made. There are many factors to consider, such as the desired size, type of plants, and location. 

## Choosing the Right Location 
The most important factor to consider is the location you choose for a windbreak. When looking for an appropriate location for the windbreak, there are two main factors that you must take into account; the prevailing wind direction and the location of other obstructions such as buildings or trees. Taking both of these into account will lead you to choose a spot that is not only sheltered from the worst of the wind, but also protected from potential obstacles. 

## Types of Plants
The next factor you must consider is the type of plants you want to use in your windbreak. Generally speaking, evergreen trees are best for windbreaks because their foliage remains intact and they are hydrophobic (capable of shedding water). Some examples of common evergreen trees used for windbreaks are pine, spruce, and fir. In addition to evergreens, deciduous trees can be used as well. Some popular deciduous trees for a windbreak are native elms, maples, and ash. 

When planting a windbreak, you will want to make sure that the trees and shrubs of various heights are planted in a staggered formation to provide the optimal wind protection. Different plants should also be spaced far enough apart that all of the plants in the windbreak can reach maximum growth.

## Maintenance 
Once the windbreak is established, regular maintenance is necessary to ensure its continued effectiveness. Pruning and thinning of the trees and plants will be necessary to maintain wind-deflecting properties. In addition, it is also important to annually fertilize and water the plants to ensure their health. 

# Conclusion 
Creating a windbreak takes careful planning and effort in order to achieve the desired result. By following the advice in this guide, you can create an effective and successful windbreak that provides protection from the wind, reduces soil erosion, improves agriculture, and provides a habitat for wildlife.
