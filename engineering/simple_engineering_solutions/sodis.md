# Comprehensive Guide to SODIS (Solar Water Disinfection)

## What is SODIS? 
SODIS, or Solar Water Disinfection, is a method of water disinfection that uses UV radiation from the sun. It is a simple, effective, and economical system for homes, communities, and organizations. The process of solar disinfection is also known as solar water pasteurization (SOP). 

SODIS is practiced around the world, particularly in developing countries and regions with limited access to clean or potable water. It has been promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other leading health agencies since 1997.

## How Does SODIS Work? 
SODIS uses the UV radiation from the sun to deactivate or destroy the diseases causing microorganisms present in the water. The solar water disinfection system relies on photosynthesis and photochemical reactions. The process of SODIS disinfects the water by altering the cellular proteins and DNA of the pathogenic organisms present in it, which in turn will reduce or eliminate the health risks associated with consuming these organisms. The most efficient way to disinfect water with solar radiation is by exposing it within PET bottles when they are left in direct sunlight for six hours.

## Advantages of SODIS
1. **Inexpensive:** SODIS is a very cost-effective method as it does not require any additional equipment or chemicals. It only needs solar radiation and common PET bottles.
2. **Easy to Use:** The SODIS system is easy to use and apply by people without any professional training in water systems. 
3. **Safe:** Since SODIS uses only solar radiation to disinfect the water, there is no risk of the water becoming contaminated with hazardous substances.
4. **Environmentally Friendly:** Since SODIS does not require any chemicals or other treatments, it is an environmentally friendly method of disinfecting water.

## Disadvantages of SODIS
1. **Time-consuming:** In order for SODIS to be effective, the water must remain in direct sunlight for at least six hours. This can be difficult in areas with very limited or unreliable access to sunlight.
2. **Limited Efficiency:** SODIS is only effective for killing certain types of organisms. It is not suitable for destroying parasites such as cryptosporidium or giardia.
3. **Susceptible to Contamination:** Since the water is exposed to the environment during the SODIS process, it may become contaminated with pollutants and sediments from the air or the soil.

## Steps for Implementing SODIS
1. **Collect Water:** Collect clean, sediment-free water from a safe source. This can be from a river, lake, spring, etc. 
2. **Filter the Water:** Use a cloth filter to remove any suspended particles from the water.
3. **Add Water to a PET Bottle:** Add the clean filtered water to a clean PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottle.
4. **Add Any Desired Purification Agents:** Any desired purification agents such as salt, chlorine, or alum can be added to the water.
5. **Cap the Bottle:** The PET bottle should be tightly capped and sealed. If using more than one bottle, make sure the bottles are placed side-by-side, not on top of each other.
6. **Place the Bottles in Direct Sunlight:** Place the bottles in direct sunlight, preferably on a reflective surface such as aluminum foil or white cloth.
7. **Expose to Sunlight for Several Hours:** The bottles should be left in the sun for at least six hours. The longer the exposure, the more effective the disinfection.
8. **Store in A Cool, Dark Place:** After the water has been exposed to sunlight for the required amount of time, it should be stored in a cool, dark place such as a covered outdoor area or a storage container.

## Conclusion
SODIS is a simple yet effective way to disinfect water and reduce the risk of waterborne diseases. It is easy to use, inexpensive, and ecologically friendly. It can be used to disinfect water in households, organizations, and communities with limited or no access to potable water. SODIS is an effective method of water disinfection, however it is important to remember that it is only effective against certain types of organisms and susceptible to external contamination.
