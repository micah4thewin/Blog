Specific Treatments for Venomous Bites and Stings:
- For snake bites, immobilize the affected limb and keep it below the heart if possible.
- For spider bites, apply a cold compress to the affected area.
- For bee or wasp stings, scrape the stinger out with a credit card or other flat object, rather than pulling it out with tweezers.
