# DIY Physical Checkup Guide

## Introduction

This guide is intended to help you perform a basic physical checkup on yourself or others in case of an emergency. It covers essential aspects of a physical examination, including neurological tests, physical metrics, and questions to ask. However, always seek professional medical help when possible. This guide is not a substitute for a qualified medical professional.

## Checklist

### General Appearance
1. **Consciousness**: Check if the person is awake, responsive, and oriented to time, place, and person.
2. **Posture**: Observe for any abnormal posture or difficulty in movement.
3. **Hygiene**: Assess the person's cleanliness and grooming.
4. **Skin**: Look for any rashes, bruises, or changes in color.

### Vital Signs
1. **Pulse**: To measure a person's pulse, follow these steps:

   a. Wash your hands and make sure the person is seated or lying down comfortably.

   b. To measure pulse at the wrist (radial pulse), use your index and middle fingers and place them on the person's wrist, on the thumb side. Apply gentle pressure until you feel the pulse. Do not use your thumb, as it has its own pulse and can interfere with accurate measurement.

   c. Alternatively, to measure pulse at the neck (carotid pulse), place your index and middle fingers on either side of the person's windpipe, in the groove between the windpipe and the neck muscles.

   d. Once you locate the pulse, count the number of beats for 30 seconds. Use a timer or watch with a second hand to ensure accurate timing.

   e. Multiply the number of beats counted in 30 seconds by 2 to get the beats per minute (BPM).

   f. Record the BPM. A normal resting pulse rate ranges from 60-100 BPM. Note any irregularities in the pulse rhythm or strength.

2. **Blood Pressure**: To measure a person's blood pressure using a manual blood pressure monitor (sphygmomanometer), follow these steps:

    a. Have the person sit down in a comfortable position with their back supported and feet flat on the floor. Make sure they are relaxed and have not consumed any caffeine, smoked, or exercised within 30 minutes before the measurement.

    b. Roll up the person's sleeve to expose the upper arm. Place the blood pressure cuff on the person's upper arm, about one inch above the elbow. The cuff should be snug but not too tight.

    c. Position the stethoscope's earpieces in your ears and place the diaphragm (the flat, circular part) over the brachial artery, which is just below the cuff's edge and slightly towards the inner side of the arm.

    d. Inflate the cuff by squeezing the bulb rapidly until the pressure gauge reads about 30 mmHg above the person's expected systolic pressure (the pressure when the heart beats). If you don't know the expected systolic pressure, inflate the cuff to about 180 mmHg.

    e. Slowly release the air from the cuff by opening the valve on the bulb. You should aim to release air at a rate of about 2-3 mmHg per second.

    f. As the air releases, listen carefully for the first Korotkoff sound (a tapping sound) through the stethoscope. This is the systolic pressure (the pressure when the heart beats). Note the pressure on the gauge when you hear this sound.

    g. Continue to release the air and listen for the point at which the sounds disappear. This is the diastolic pressure (the pressure when the heart is at rest). Note the pressure on the gauge when the sounds disappear.

    h. Record the blood pressure as systolic/diastolic (e.g., 120/80 mmHg). The ideal blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. Consistently high or low readings are red flags and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.

3. **Respiration**: To measure a person's respiratory rate, follow these steps:

    a. Have the person sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Make sure they are relaxed and not talking or laughing during the measurement.

    b. Stand or sit next to the person, where you can clearly observe their chest or abdomen rise and fall with each breath.

    c. Set a timer or watch with a second hand to count for 30 seconds.

    d. Count the number of breaths the person takes during the 30-second period. One breath consists of one inhalation (chest or abdomen rises) and one exhalation (chest or abdomen falls).

    e. Multiply the number of breaths counted in 30 seconds by 2 to get the breaths per minute.

    f. Record the breaths per minute. A normal resting respiratory rate ranges from 12-20 breaths per minute. Red flags include difficulty breathing, very slow or fast rate, or any abnormal breathing sounds.

4. **Temperature**: To measure a person's body temperature using a digital thermometer, follow these steps:

    a. Choose the appropriate type of thermometer based on the person's age and preference. For example, use an oral thermometer for adults or older children, and a rectal or armpit thermometer for infants or small children.

    b. Clean the thermometer with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Rinse thoroughly and dry.

    c. Turn on the digital thermometer and wait for it to display the ready signal (usually a beep or a flashing symbol).

    d. For oral temperature:
          - Have the person sit comfortably and place the thermometer's probe under their tongue.
          - Instruct them to close their mouth and breathe through their nose, keeping their lips closed around the thermometer.

    e. For armpit temperature:
          - Remove the person's shirt or lift it up to expose the armpit.
          - Place the thermometer's probe in the center of the armpit and bring the arm down to hold it in place.

   f. For rectal temperature (usually for infants):
          - Lay the baby on their back or stomach and remove the diaper.
          - Insert the thermometer's probe gently into the rectum, about half an inch for babies and an inch for older children. Use a lubricant to ease insertion, if needed.

    g. Wait for the thermometer to beep or signal that the reading is complete, then remove the thermometer and read the temperature.

    h. Record the temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The ideal body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Red flags include fever (temperature above 100.4°F/38°C) or hypothermia (temperature below 95°F/35°C).

    i. Clean the thermometer again and store it properly for future use.


### Neurological Examination
1. **Speech**: Evaluate the person's speech for any slurring, difficulty in speaking, or inability to understand speech.
2. **Reflexes**: Check the person's reflexes using a reflex hammer on their knees, elbows, and ankles. Red flags: absent or exaggerated reflexes.
3. **Sensory Function**: Assess the person's ability to feel touch, pain, and temperature in different parts of the body.
4. **Motor Function**: Test the person's ability to move their limbs and maintain balance.

### Questions to Ask
1. **Allergies**: Ask if the person has any known allergies to medications, food, or other substances.
2. **Medications**: Inquire about any current medications or recent changes in medications.
3. **Injuries**: Ask about any recent injuries, falls, or accidents.
4. **Past Medical History**: Gather information about any chronic illnesses, surgeries, or relevant medical history.

## Documentation

Keep a record of your findings, including vital signs, neurological tests, and answers to the questions asked. This information can be helpful for medical professionals when providing treatment.
