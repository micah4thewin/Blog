# Makeshift IV Fluids in Extreme Situations (Hypothetical Guide)

**Note:** This guide is for informational purposes only and should not replace proper medical training. In an emergency, always call for professional medical help.

## Step 1: Water purification
To purify water, consider using a multi-step process involving filtering, boiling, and chemical treatment (if available). This will help ensure the water is as clean as possible before using it for any purpose.

### 1.1: Pre-filtering
Start by filtering the water through a clean cloth or makeshift filter (e.g., using layers of sand, gravel, and activated charcoal) to remove larger particles and debris. This will help improve the effectiveness of the subsequent purification steps.

### 1.2: Boiling
Boiling water is an effective way to kill most bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Bring the filtered water to a rolling boil and maintain it for at least one minute. If you are at an altitude of over 6,500 feet (1,981 meters), increase the boiling time to at least three minutes.

### 1.3: Chemical treatment
If iodine or chlorine tablets are available, they can be used as an additional disinfection method. Follow the instructions on the package to determine the appropriate dosage and contact time for the specific tablets you have. Be sure to wait for the recommended time before using the water.

### 1.4: Post-filtering (optional)
After the water has been treated with chemicals, you may notice a taste or smell from the disinfectants. To help remove these, you can filter the water again through an activated charcoal filter. This step is optional and mainly serves to improve the taste and smell of the water.

Remember, this process is not equivalent to professional water purification methods used in medical settings, but it may provide a cleaner source of water in extreme situations where no other options are available.

## Step 2: Electrolyte solution
Normal saline is a 0.9% sodium chloride solution, meaning it contains 9 grams of sodium chloride (common table salt) per liter of water. Ensure that the table salt is pure and non-iodized.

1. Measure the appropriate amount of salt: To make one liter of normal saline, you will need to measure out 9 grams of pure, non-iodized table salt. A food scale may be used to ensure accuracy in measuring the salt.

2. Dissolve the salt: Add the measured amount of salt to the purified water and stir until it is completely dissolved. It is important to make sure the salt is fully dissolved to ensure a consistent concentration of electrolytes in the solution. This can be achieved by stirring the solution vigorously or by using a magnetic stir bar if available.

Note: It's important to measure the salt precisely, as too little or too much salt can cause complications in the patient. Also, make sure that the solution is thoroughly mixed, so that the salt is evenly distributed throughout the water.

## Step 3: Sterilization
Since you won't have access to medical-grade sterilization equipment in an apocalyptic scenario, additional sterilization might be limited to boiling the solution again for at least one minute. Be aware that this is not an ideal method for sterilizing IV fluids, as it may not eliminate all potential contaminants.

## Step 4: Administration
Administering IV fluids without proper equipment and training is extremely risky. However, if you absolutely must proceed:

1. Sterilize a needle and tubing (if available) by boiling them for at least one minute.
2. Locate a suitable vein, insert the needle, and slowly administer the saline solution.
3. Monitor the individual closely for any signs of adverse reactions.
