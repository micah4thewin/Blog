# If you are faced with a situation where someone has experienced severe bodily trauma, follow these steps:

## Assess the situation:

- Make sure the scene is safe and free from potential hazards.
- Call for emergency medical help if it is available.
- Check the person's airway, breathing, and circulation. If they are not breathing, perform CPR if you are trained to do so.

## Triage priorities:

- Attend to life-threatening injuries first, such as severe bleeding or difficulty breathing.
- Attend to injuries that may cause disability, such as spinal cord injuries, fractures, or head injuries.
- Attend to other injuries as needed.

## Immobilization:

- If you suspect a spinal cord injury, immobilize the person's head, neck, and back.
- Immobilize any fractures or suspected fractures.
- Keep the person as still as possible.

## Checking for a pulse:

- Check for a pulse and assess the person's level of consciousness.
- If the person is unconscious, begin CPR immediately.

## Neurological assessments and tests:

- Check the person's pupils for size, equality, and reactivity to light.
- Check the person's motor and sensory responses to determine if they have any neurological deficits.
- Ask the person if they have any tingling or numbness in their extremities.

## Determining if the person has internal bleeding:

- Look for signs of shock, such as rapid breathing or a rapid heartbeat.
- Check for signs of internal bleeding, such as swelling or discoloration.

## Determining if the person has injuries they cannot feel:

- Ask the person if they have any areas of pain or discomfort that are not related to any visible injuries.

## Questions to ask the person in case they go out of consciousness:

- Ask the person their name, where they are, and what happened.
- Ask if they have any medical conditions or allergies.

## Information to gather for investigators and doctors:

- Note the time of the injury and the time you arrived on the scene.
- Note any medications the person is taking or any medical conditions they have.
- Take pictures of any visible injuries.

## What to tell the person to stay calm and to help give them confidence:

- Reassure the person that help is on the way.
- Encourage the person to remain calm and to keep still.
- Explain what you are doing and why.

## What definitely not to do:

- Do not move the person unless it is necessary to keep them safe.
- Do not give the person anything to eat or drink.
- Do not remove any impaled objects.
- Do not attempt to clean or dress any wounds.
- Do not give the person any medication unless instructed to do so by a medical professional.
