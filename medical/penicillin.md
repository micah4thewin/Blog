# Homemade Penicillin Production Guide

## Step 1: Gather materials and equipment
- Glass container (e.g. a jar or flask)
- Sterile cloth or cheesecloth
- Rubber band
- Glass or plastic stirring rod
- Glass or plastic funnel
- Sterile filter paper or coffee filter
- Alcohol (70% isopropyl or ethanol) for sterilization
- Distilled water
- Sugar
- Citric acid or lemon juice
- Sodium nitrate (optional)
- Penicillium mold (can be found on moldy bread or fruit)

## Step 2: Sterilize your equipment
1. Clean your glass container, stirring rod, funnel, and any other equipment with soap and water.
2. Rinse thoroughly with distilled water.
3. Wipe down the equipment with alcohol to sterilize.

## Step 3: Prepare the growth medium
1. Measure 1 liter of distilled water and pour it into a clean container. Distilled water is important because it is free of impurities and contaminants that could affect the growth of the Penicillium mold.
2. Weigh 20 grams of sugar (preferably a simple sugar like glucose or sucrose) and add it to the distilled water. Sugar serves as a carbon source for the mold, providing it with the necessary energy to grow and produce penicillin.
3. Weigh 1 gram of citric acid or prepare a few drops of lemon juice (which contains citric acid). Add the citric acid or lemon juice to the mixture. This helps to create a slightly acidic environment, which is optimal for the growth of Penicillium mold and penicillin production. The ideal pH range for Penicillium mold growth is between 5.0 and 6.0.
4. Optionally, weigh 3 grams of sodium nitrate and add it to the mixture. Sodium nitrate serves as a nitrogen source for the mold, which is necessary for the synthesis of proteins and other important cellular components. Although not essential, adding sodium nitrate can improve the growth and penicillin production of the mold.
5. Use a sterilized glass or plastic stirring rod to mix the ingredients in the container until they are fully dissolved. Make sure the sugar, citric acid, and sodium nitrate (if used) are completely dissolved before proceeding to the next step. This will ensure a homogenous growth medium for the Penicillium mold.

## Step 4: Inoculate the growth medium with Penicillium mold
1. Locate a suitable source of Penicillium mold, which can often be found on moldy bread or fruit. Look for mold with a bluish-green color, which is characteristic of Penicillium species. However, keep in mind that identifying mold by color alone is not foolproof, and there's a risk of choosing a different or harmful mold species.
2. Sterilize a pair of tweezers or a small spatula with alcohol (70% isopropyl or ethanol) and allow it to air dry.
3. Using the sterilized tweezers or spatula, carefully transfer a small amount of Penicillium mold from the moldy bread or fruit into the sterilized glass container containing the growth medium. Try to minimize exposure to air and other contaminants while doing this, as it can introduce unwanted organisms into the growth medium.
4. Once the mold has been transferred, use the sterilized glass or plastic stirring rod to gently mix the mold into the growth medium. This will ensure that the mold is evenly distributed throughout the medium, promoting optimal growth and penicillin production.

## Step 5: Allow the mold to grow
1. After inoculating the growth medium with Penicillium mold, prepare a sterile cloth or cheesecloth to cover the container. Sterilize the cloth by soaking it in alcohol (70% isopropyl or ethanol) and allowing it to air dry. Once dry, cover the opening of the container with the cloth, ensuring that it is taut and secure. Use a rubber band to hold the cloth in place. This setup allows air to circulate, which is essential for the mold's growth, while also preventing contamination from other organisms.
2. Find a dark and stable storage space with a temperature range of 20-25°C (68-77°F). Penicillium mold grows best under these conditions, and darkness helps prevent the growth of unwanted photosynthetic organisms like algae. Keep the container in this storage space for 7 to 14 days.
3. Check on the container daily to monitor the growth of the Penicillium mold. You should see a visible layer of bluish-green mold forming on the surface of the growth medium. If you notice any unusual colors or signs of contamination, such as bacterial growth or other mold species, it is best to discard the batch and start over with a new, sterile setup. It's crucial to maintain a clean and uncontaminated environment for the mold to grow and produce penicillin effectively.

## Step 6: Extract the penicillin
1. After 7 to 14 days of growth, the Penicillium mold should have produced penicillin, which is now present in the liquid growth medium. Carefully remove the sterile cloth or cheesecloth cover from the container, ensuring that you do not introduce contaminants into the mixture.
2. Prepare a clean, sterilized glass or plastic funnel and a piece of sterile filter paper or a coffee filter. To sterilize the funnel, rinse it with alcohol (70% isopropyl or ethanol) and allow it to air dry. If using filter paper, you can briefly soak it in alcohol and then let it air dry as well. Coffee filters are generally clean enough for this purpose, but you may also want to rinse them with alcohol for added safety.
3. Place the filter paper or coffee filter inside the funnel, and position the funnel over a clean, sterilized container. The container should be large enough to hold the liquid from the initial growth medium.
4. Slowly and carefully pour the liquid from the mold growth container through the funnel, allowing the liquid to pass through the filter paper or coffee filter. The filter will trap the mold and any solid particles, while the liquid containing penicillin will pass through into the container below. This process helps to separate the penicillin from the mold and other debris, resulting in a crude penicillin solution.

## Step 7: Purify the penicillin (Optional - Requires specialized knowledge and equipment)
1. The crude penicillin solution obtained from the previous step contains impurities and may not be safe for direct human use. In a laboratory setting, the penicillin would be purified using various techniques to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Some common purification methods include:
   - Crystallization: A process that involves dissolving the crude penicillin in a solvent and then allowing it to slowly recrystallize as a pure solid, leaving impurities behind in the solvent.
   - Chromatography: A technique that separates the components of a mixture (like penicillin and impurities) based on their physical and chemical properties. This can be achieved using various chromatographic methods such as column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, or high-performance liquid chromatography.
   - Solvent extraction: A method that involves separating penicillin from impurities by selectively dissolving it in a solvent while leaving impurities behind. This is often done using multiple liquid-liquid extraction steps to increase the purity of the penicillin.
2. Purifying penicillin without proper equipment, knowledge, and a controlled environment can be dangerous and is not recommended. Improper purification can result in an impure or contaminated product that may cause harm or be ineffective. In emergency situations, it is crucial to seek help from professionals or experts in your community who can provide guidance and access to the necessary resources.
