Making beautiful, aromatic candles at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. Knowing the basics of this fun activity is essential for success, so here is a comprehensive guide to making homemade candles. 

## Supplies Needed
Before you start making your own candles, it’s important to make sure you have the supplies needed. This is a basic list of supplies you will need for creating candles at home:

- Wax 
- Wick 
- Wick tab 
- Wick sustainer 
- Wax melting pot 
- Fragrance 
- Dye 
- Glass or container 
- Thermometer 
- Spatula 
- Wicking Needle

## Types of Wax
When making candles, there are a variety of waxes to choose from. Soy wax, paraffin wax, beeswax, and coconut wax are all great options. It can be helpful to do some research on each type of wax, so here is a description of each wax type and its uses:

### Soy Wax 
Soy wax is known for its clean burn and environmentally friendly properties. Soy wax does not produce soot when burned, making it a great choice for making candles that produce a clean burn. Additionally, soy wax is renewable and sustainable.

### Paraffin Wax
Paraffin wax is known for its affordability and great scent throw. Paraffin wax is a petroleum-based wax, making it one of the cheapest waxes to work with. However, it can produce a lot of soot when burned. 

### Beeswax
Beeswax is a natural wax that has a pleasant honey aroma. Beeswax is very hard, making it great for using as an additive to other waxes to harden them up. 

### Coconut Wax
Coconut wax is a natural wax made from the oil of the coconut. It is known for its great scent throw and long lasting burn time. Coconut wax is also great for candles that require high amounts of fragrance because it can hold large amounts of oils. 

## Wicks
Once you’ve chosen the wax, you’ll need to choose a wick. The wick should be chosen depending on the type of wax being used and the size of candle being made. Knowing the size of the container and type of wax being used is key in choosing the right wick. For example, if you’re making a 4-inch diameter container candle with soy wax, you’ll need a wick size 6. Here is a useful wicking chart that can help when choosing a wick:

## Fragrance & Dye
Adding fragrance and dye is where you can get creative and customize your candles. When selecting your fragrance, more isn’t always better. Fragrance oils can be overpowering if used in excess, and the amount needed can vary depending on the type of wax you use. You should also use candle dyes designed specifically for candles. 

## Melting the Wax
Once you’ve gathered all of your supplies, you’re ready to start melting the wax. It’s important to stay within specific temperature ranges when melting wax in order to get the best results. 

### Preparing Your Wax
First, you will need to break the wax into small pieces. This is important because it will allow for the wax to melt easier and quicker. When cutting the wax, you may want to wear gloves for safety. 

### Melting the Wax
Once the wax has been prepared, it’s time to place it in your wax melting pot. Make sure the pot is placed on a flat surface and has a secure fit to prevent any accidents. You should also have your thermometer ready to place in the wax once melting has begun. You’ll want to keep an eye on the temperature of the wax and make sure it doesn’t exceed its melting point. 

Once the wax is completely melted, it’s time to add your dye, fragrance, and wick. 

### Adding Fragrance and Dye
When adding fragrance and dye, you will first need to add the dye to the melted wax and stir it. Then, you can add the fragrance oil. When adding the fragrance oil, you will need to use the proper amount that is recommended for the type of wax you are using. 

You should also add the wick tab and sustainer to the melted wax and stir them in. This will help keep the wick in place. 

### Pouring the Wax
Once the wax has been completely melted and the dye, fragrance, and wick have been added, it’s time to pour the wax into the container or mold you’re using. The wax should not be too hot when you’re pouring it. The ideal temperature range is between 135-145 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Once the wax has been poured, you may need to use your wick needle to re-adjust the wick if it’s not positioned correctly. 

## Wrapping it up

After the wax has been poured, you’ll need to let it set and cool. Depending on the type of wax you’re using, it can take anywhere from a few hours to a full day for the wax to completely set. Once the wax has completely cooled and set, you can trim the wick to the desired length. 

And you’re finished! Making homemade candles can be a fun and rewarding experience. Whether you’re giving them as gifts or simply enjoying the fragrance, candles made by hand can be real works of art.
