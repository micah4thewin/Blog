# Wood Gasifier Stove Guide

## What is a Wood Gasifier Stove?
A wood gasifier stove is a type of compact, portable stove that uses wood or other biomass as its primary fuel source. It produces a flammable gas by heating wood in an oxygen-deprived environment. This gas is then burned in an efficient combustion chamber and used to cook food or heat water. As opposed to traditional wood fires, wood gasifier stoves create a much more efficient burn with fewer emissions and significantly less smoke.

## How Does a Wood Gasifier Stove Work?
A wood gasifier stove works by converting solid biomass into a combustible gas through a process called pyrolysis[^1^][4]. Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. During pyrolysis, biomass breaks down into three main components: gas, liquid, and char. The gas consists of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, and other volatile compounds. The liquid consists of water, tar, and acids. The char consists of carbon and ash.

In a wood gasifier stove, this process happens inside a closed combustion chamber where air supply is controlled to prevent complete combustion of biomass. The biomass feedstock is introduced at the top of the chamber while air enters from below. Heat rises through the chamber and initiates pyrolysis on contact with the biomass feedstock[^1^][4].

The gas produced by pyrolysis then rises to the top of the chamber where it meets a secondary air supply. This air supply provides enough oxygen for the gas to burn cleanly and efficiently in the combustion chamber[^1^][4]. The heat generated by the combustion can then be used to cook food or heat water on a pot stand above the stove.

The liquid and char produced by pyrolysis remain at the bottom of the chamber where they are either consumed by the primary air supply or removed as waste[^1^][4]. The liquid can also be collected and used as a fuel or fertilizer.

## Benefits of Using a Wood Gasifier Stove
Using a wood gasifier stove offers many benefits over more traditional wood burning stoves. These benefits include: 

* **High Efficiency:** A wood gasifier stove produces a much more efficient burn than a traditional wood stove. The gas created is easily and cleanly burned in the combustion chamber of the stove, providing more heat per unit of fuel burned[^1^][4]. This means that less fuel is needed to achieve the same cooking or heating results, saving time and money.

* **Reduced Emissions:** Since wood gasifier stoves burn the gas they produce very cleanly in the combustion chamber, the amount of smoke and other gaseous emissions produced by the stove are kept to a minimum[^1^][4]. This can be especially beneficial in areas that are prone to air pollution or have limited ventilation. Wood gasifier stoves also produce less carbon dioxide than traditional wood stoves, reducing their impact on climate change.

* **Low Maintenance:** Wood gasifier stoves require significantly less maintenance compared to traditional wood burning stoves. Since they do not produce the same amount of smoke and ash, they will not need to be cleaned as often[^2^][1]. They also do not require any electricity or batteries to operate, making them more reliable and convenient.

* **Portability:** Wood gasifier stoves are usually compact and lightweight, making them much easier to transport than traditional wood burning stoves[^2^][1]. This makes them ideal for camping trips or other short-term trips away from home. They can also be used in emergency situations where other fuel sources are unavailable or unreliable.

## How to Choose a Wood Gasifier Stove
When selecting a wood gasifier stove, there are a few key factors to keep in mind:

* **Size of the Stove:** The size of the stove will determine how much fuel it can hold at once and how much heat it is capable of generating. If you are going to be using the stove to cook food or to heat water, larger stoves are usually more suitable[^2^][1]. Larger stoves can also accommodate larger pots and pans, making them more versatile for different cooking needs.

* **Simplicity of Design:** Wood gasifier stoves usually come in two types: open or closed[^2^][1]. Open stoves will generally require more user maintenance, as they need to be opened in order to facilitate the wood gasification process. They also tend to produce more smoke and ash than closed stoves. Closed stoves, on the other hand, will generally be easier to maintain, as they are completely sealed and require less active interaction. They also tend to produce less smoke and ash than open stoves.

* **Fuel Type:** Different wood gasifier stoves are capable of burning different types of fuel. Some are designed specifically for burning wood, while others are capable of burning a variety of combustible materials such as charcoal, twigs and leaves[^2^][1]. It is important to select a stove that is capable of burning the type of fuel that you have available or can easily obtain. You should also consider the quality and moisture content of the fuel, as this can affect the performance and efficiency of the stove.

* **Cost:** The price of wood gasifier stoves can vary widely, depending on their size, design, and energy efficiency. As with most things, you usually get what you pay for â€“ more expensive stoves are usually of better quality and have greater fuel efficiency[^2^][1]. However, you should also consider your budget and personal preferences when choosing a stove. You may be able to find a cheaper stove that meets your needs or a more expensive stove that offers extra features or benefits.

## How to Build a Wood Gasifier Stove
If you are feeling adventurous and handy, you can also build your own wood gasifier stove using simple materials and tools. There are many different designs and methods for building a wood gasifier stove, but one of the most popular and easy ones is the TLUD (Top-Lit Up-Draft) method[^3^][2]. This method involves using two tin cans, one slightly larger than the other, to create a simple but effective wood gasifier stove.

Here are the basic steps for building a TLUD wood gasifier stove[^3^][2]:

1. Cut off the bottom of the larger can and turn it into a rim that fits around the smaller can. This will create a snug fit for the inner and outer parts of the stove.
2. Punch and drill a series of holes around the bottom of the larger can and around the bottom and top, as well as through the base, of the smaller can. These holes will allow air to enter and exit the stove, as well as create jets for the gas to burn.
3. Assemble the stove by placing the smaller can inside the larger can and securing them with the rim.
4. Fill the smaller can with small pieces of dry wood or other biomass. Place some paper or lint on top of the wood and then some kindling.
5. Light the paper or lint from the top of the stove and wait for the fire to spread downwards through the wood.
6. Once the fire reaches the bottom of the smaller can, place a pot stand over the stove and use it to cook food or heat water.

## Safety Tips for Using a Wood Gasifier Stove
As with any type of fire, it is important to be careful when using a wood gasifier stove. Here are some tips for ensuring safe usage:

* **Clear the Area:** Before lighting the stove, make sure that the area is free of debris and anything that could catch fire. Make sure that you keep an up-to-date fire extinguisher close by in case of an emergency.
* **Attend to the Fire:** Once the fire is lit, do not leave it unattended. Wood gasifier stoves require active monitoring to ensure that they burn cleanly and efficiently. 
* **Keep Children Away:** Make sure that children and pets are not near the stove while it is lit. Teach children the importance of never touching a lit stove.
* **Allow the Fire to Burn Out:** Before putting out the fire, make sure that the wood has completely burned out. This is important to ensure that no unburned fuel is left in the stove.

## Conclusion
Wood gasifier stoves are a great way to cook food or heat water using wood or other biomass as the fuel source. They are much more efficient than traditional wood burning stoves, producing less smoke and fewer emissions. When selecting and using a wood gasifier stove, it is important to be aware of the different factors to consider, such as size, design, fuel type and cost, as well as safety tips for proper usage. You can also build your own wood gasifier stove using simple materials and tools if you want to save money or have some fun. Follow these guidelines and you can enjoy the many benefits of a wood gasifier stove without compromising safety.
