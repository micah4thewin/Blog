# DIY Emergency Heaters

DIY emergency heaters are devices that can provide heat and warmth in situations where there is no electricity or other conventional heating sources available. They can be useful for survival, camping, or emergencies such as power outages, natural disasters, or extreme cold. 

There are many different types of DIY emergency heaters that can be made from everyday household items, such as candles, alcohol, tin cans, toilet paper, flower pots, and more. In this guide, we will show you how to make five of the most popular and effective DIY emergency heaters and explain their benefits and drawbacks.

## 1. Tin Can, Alcohol and Toilet Paper Heater

This emergency heater consists of a tin can (large soup cans and gallon paint cans work well), toilet paper, and isopropyl alcohol (70% solution or higher). [^1^][1]

- Place a roll of toilet paper into a tin can. Make sure it fits snugly and remove the cardboard tube from the center.
- Pour the alcohol over the toilet paper until it is just saturated. Do not overfill the can or spill the alcohol.
- Light the alcohol on fire with a match or lighter. The toilet paper will act as a wick and burn slowly and steadily.

This heater can produce a lot of heat and last for several hours, depending on the size of the can and the amount of alcohol used. It can also be easily extinguished by placing a lid over the can or smothering the flame with a damp cloth.

#### Benefits

- Easy to make with common items
- Produces a lot of heat
- Long-lasting
- Easy to extinguish

#### Drawbacks

- Requires flammable alcohol
- Can be dangerous if spilled or knocked over
- Can produce carbon monoxide and smoke if not ventilated properly

## 2. Terracotta (Flower Pot) and Tea Light Heater

This emergency heater consists of a terracotta flower pot (or two), some tea light candles, a metal tray or cake pan, and some nuts and bolts. [^2^][2]

- Place four nuts on the metal tray as spacers. Place four tea light candles on top of the nuts.
- Light the candles with a match or lighter.
- Place a bolt upside down in the center of the tray. Place a smaller flower pot over the bolt and candles. The hole in the bottom of the pot should fit over the bolt head.
- Place another bolt upside down on top of the smaller pot. Place a larger flower pot over the bolt and smaller pot. The hole in the bottom of the pot should fit over the bolt head.
- Optionally, you can place more nuts on top of the larger pot to create an air gap for better heat circulation.

This heater works by trapping and radiating the heat from the candles through the flower pots. It can produce a moderate amount of heat and last for several hours, depending on the number and quality of the candles used.

#### Benefits

- Easy to make with common items
- Produces a moderate amount of heat
- Long-lasting
- Safe and stable

#### Drawbacks

- Requires multiple flower pots
- Requires tea light candles
- Can produce carbon monoxide and smoke if not ventilated properly

## 3. Rocket Stove Heater

This emergency heater consists of a metal bucket or barrel, some metal cans or pipes, some insulation material (such as sand, dirt, ash, or perlite), and some wood or biomass fuel. [^3^][3]

- Cut a hole in the side of the bucket near the bottom. The hole should be slightly larger than the diameter of your metal can or pipe.
- Cut another hole in the lid of the bucket near the center. The hole should be slightly larger than the diameter of your metal can or pipe.
- Cut one end off your metal can or pipe. This will be your fuel chamber. Cut another hole near one end of your metal can or pipe. This will be your air intake.
- Insert your fuel chamber into the hole in the side of the bucket. The open end should face inward and upward. The air intake should face outward.
- Insert another metal can or pipe into the hole in the lid of the bucket. This will be your chimney. The open end should face upward.
- Fill the space between your fuel chamber and chimney with insulation material. This will help retain and reflect heat inside your stove.
- Light some wood or biomass fuel inside your fuel chamber with a match or lighter. Feed more fuel as needed through the open end of the fuel chamber.

This heater works by creating a draft of air that feeds the fire and exits through the chimney. It can produce a lot of heat and last for as long as you have fuel. It can also be used for cooking or boiling water.

#### Benefits

- Easy to make with common items
- Produces a lot of heat
- Long-lasting
- Can be used for cooking or boiling water

#### Drawbacks

- Requires a metal bucket or barrel
- Requires metal cans or pipes
- Requires insulation material
- Can produce smoke and sparks if not ventilated properly

## 4. Paper Log Heater

This emergency heater consists of paper logs made from shredded paper, water, and a mold (such as a milk carton or a PVC pipe). [^4^][4]

- Shred some paper into small pieces. You can use any kind of paper, such as newspaper, junk mail, or cardboard.
- Soak the paper in water for several hours or overnight. You can add some bleach or vinegar to prevent mold growth.
- Drain the water and squeeze out the excess moisture from the paper. You can use a colander or a cloth bag for this step.
- Pack the paper tightly into your mold. You can use a milk carton, a PVC pipe, or any other container that has a rectangular or cylindrical shape.
- Let the paper dry completely. You can place it in the sun, in an oven, or near a heat source. This may take several days depending on the humidity and temperature.
- Remove the paper log from the mold. You can cut it into smaller pieces if needed.

This heater works by burning the paper logs as fuel. They can produce a moderate amount of heat and last for about an hour, depending on the size and density of the logs.

#### Benefits

- Easy to make with common items
- Produces a moderate amount of heat
- Recycles waste paper

#### Drawbacks

- Requires shredding and soaking paper
- Requires drying time
- Can produce smoke and ash if not ventilated properly

## 5. DIY Solar Heater from Tin Cans

This emergency heater consists of tin cans, black paint, a wooden box, some glass or plastic, and some duct tape or glue. [^5^][5]

- Clean and dry your tin cans. Remove any labels and sharp edges.
- Paint your tin cans black. This will help them absorb more heat from the sun.
- Cut holes in the bottom and top of each can. The holes should be slightly smaller than the diameter of the cans.
- Stack your cans together to form columns. You can use duct tape or glue to secure them together.
- Cut holes in the bottom and top of your wooden box. The holes should match the size and position of your can columns.
- Insert your can columns into your wooden box. The open ends of the cans should align with the holes in the box.
- Cover the front of your wooden box with glass or plastic. You can use duct tape or glue to seal it.
- Place your solar heater in a sunny spot facing south. The glass or plastic should face the sun.

This heater works by trapping and circulating the heat from the sun through the tin cans. It can produce a moderate amount of heat and last for as long as there is sunlight.

#### Benefits

- Easy to make with common items
- Produces a moderate amount of heat
- Uses renewable energy

#### Drawbacks

- Requires tin cans
- Requires black paint
- Requires wooden box
- Requires glass or plastic
- Only works during daylight hours
