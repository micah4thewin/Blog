# A Comprehensive Guide to Natural Insect Repellent 

Insects can make outdoor activities, even during the summer months, less than enjoyable. Mosquitoes, ticks, gnats, no-see-ums, and other summer pests can turn a barbecue, campout, or picnic into an itchy, miserable experience. Traditional insect repellents are often effective, but some contain chemicals with side effects that can include itchiness, rashes, and even headaches. 

Fortunately, there are natural insect repellents that work just as well as, if not better, than chemical-based repellents. This guide will introduce you to natural insect repellent so you can choose the option that is best for you and your family.

## What is Natural Insect Repellent?

Natural insect repellents are products made from natural ingredients including plant oils, extracts, and other substances that effectively repel insects without the need for harsh chemicals. Natural insect repellents tend to have fewer harsh chemicals, making them less likely to cause irritation or other adverse reactions.

## How Does Natural Insect Repellent Work?

Natural insect repellents work in the same way as chemical-based repellents. These products contain natural substances that create a barrier around the user, which repels and wards off insects. These natural ingredients can block the scent, vision, and infrared signals that insects use to locate their prey, making users less attractive to these pests.

## What Kinds of Natural Insect Repellents Are Available?

Natural insect repellents come in a variety of forms, including sprays, lotions, gels, oils, and candles. 

### Sprays

Sprays are an easy, convenient, and mess-free way to apply insect repellent. Natural insect repellent sprays often contain essential oils, such as citronella oil, lavender oil, and peppermint oil. These oils have a strong scent that repels most insects.

### Lotions

Lotions are another popular form of natural insect repellent that can offer longer lasting insect protection. Lotions often contain natural ingredients such as citronella, soybean oil, and geranium oil which can act as a natural barrier against bugs.

### Gels

Gels are an effective and easy way to apply natural insect repellent. Natural insect repellent gels often contain essential oils such as tea tree oil, lemon eucalyptus oil, and eucalyptus globulus oil which offer protection from insects.

### Oils

Natural insect repellent oils are a potent and effective way to repel insects. They are usually applied directly to the skin and are available in a variety of forms, including liquid, solid, and spray. Natural insect repellent oils often contain ingredients such as pennyroyal, catnip, and citronella oil which can help keep bugs away.

### Candles

Candles can also be an effective form of natural insect repellents. Candles often contain essential oils, such as citronella, lemongrass, and eucalyptus which have a pleasant smell, and create a smoke-like barrier to keep insects away.
