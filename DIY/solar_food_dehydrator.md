## DIY Solar Food Dehydrator Guide

A solar food dehydrator is a device used to remove moisture from food using the power of the sun. It typically consists of a box-like structure with a clear top and bottom, which allows sunlight to enter and heat to build up inside. The heated air then flows through trays of food and escapes through vents, carrying away the moisture. A solar food dehydrator can be a great way to preserve food without using electricity or gas, and it can be made with simple materials and tools.

### Benefits of Solar Food Dehydrators

There are many benefits of using a solar food dehydrator, such as:

- **Saving Money:** A solar food dehydrator can help you save money on food costs by allowing you to buy food in bulk when it is in season and cheap, and then dry it for later use. You can also save money on energy costs by using free solar power instead of electricity or gas.
- **Reducing Waste:** A solar food dehydrator can help you reduce food waste by extending the shelf life of food that would otherwise spoil or go bad. You can also use it to dry food scraps or leftovers that you would normally throw away, such as fruit peels, vegetable stems, or herb stems.
- **Improving Nutrition:** A solar food dehydrator can help you improve your nutrition by preserving the vitamins, minerals, and enzymes in food that are often lost during cooking or canning. Dried food also retains its natural flavor and color, making it more appealing and tasty.
- **Enhancing Creativity:** A solar food dehydrator can help you enhance your creativity by allowing you to make your own dried snacks, herbs, spices, teas, and more. You can experiment with different combinations of ingredients, flavors, and textures, and create your own unique recipes.

### Understanding Solar Food Dehydrator Components

In order to build a solar food dehydrator, it’s important to understand the components that make up the device. The main components of a solar food dehydrator include:

- **Box:** The box is the main structure of the dehydrator that holds the trays of food and creates a greenhouse effect. It can be made of wood, metal, plastic, or cardboard, depending on your preference and budget. The box should have a clear top and bottom to allow sunlight to enter and heat to build up inside. It should also have vents on the sides or back to allow air circulation and moisture escape.
- **Trays:** The trays are the platforms where the food is placed for drying. They can be made of wire mesh, screen, or perforated metal, depending on the type and size of food you want to dry. The trays should fit snugly inside the box and have enough space between them to allow air flow.
- **Stand:** The stand is the support structure that holds the box at an angle facing the sun. It can be made of wood, metal, or PVC pipes, depending on your preference and budget. The stand should be sturdy and stable enough to withstand wind and weather conditions.
- **Thermometer:** The thermometer is an optional but useful component that helps you monitor the temperature inside the box. It can be a simple dial thermometer or a digital thermometer with a probe that can be inserted into the box. The ideal temperature range for drying food is between 95°F and 145°F.

### How to Build a Solar Food Dehydrator

Building a solar food dehydrator can be a fun and rewarding project that requires some basic skills and tools. There are many different designs and methods for building a solar food dehydrator, but one of the most popular and easy ones is based on this video by Big Family Homestead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzgi76N3j2E

Here are the basic steps for building a solar food dehydrator based on this video:

1. **Gather Your Materials:** You will need the following materials to build your solar food dehydrator:

  - A wooden box with a hinged lid (you can use an old crate or make your own)
  - A sheet of clear plastic (you can use an old window or greenhouse panel)
  - A roll of aluminum foil
  - A roll of duct tape
  - Some wire mesh or screen
  - Some wooden dowels or sticks
  - Some screws or nails
  - A drill or hammer
  - A saw or scissors
  - A measuring tape or ruler
  - A marker or pencil
  - A thermometer (optional)

2. **Prepare the Box:** You will need to prepare the box for the dehydrator by doing the following:

  - Cut a hole on the bottom of the box that is slightly smaller than the sheet of clear plastic.
  - Cut a hole on the back of the box that is slightly smaller than the thermometer (if using).
  - Cover the inside of the box and the lid with aluminum foil, using duct tape to secure it. This will help reflect the sunlight and heat inside the box.
  - Attach the sheet of clear plastic to the bottom of the box, using duct tape to seal the edges. This will create a clear window for the sunlight to enter.
  - Attach the thermometer to the back of the box, if using, and insert the probe into the box.

3. **Make the Trays:** You will need to make the trays for the dehydrator by doing the following:

  - Measure and cut the wire mesh or screen into rectangles that fit inside the box, leaving some space around them for air circulation. You can make as many trays as you want, depending on how much food you want to dry at once.
  - Measure and cut the wooden dowels or sticks into pieces that are slightly longer than the width of the box. You will need two pieces for each tray.
  - Drill or hammer holes on the sides of the box, about an inch below the top edge, and spaced evenly apart. These holes will hold the dowels or sticks that will support the trays.
  - Insert the dowels or sticks into the holes on one side of the box, then slide a tray onto them, and insert them into the holes on the other side of the box. Repeat this process for each tray, leaving some space between them for air flow.

4. **Make the Stand:** You will need to make a stand for your dehydrator by doing one of the following:

  - Use an existing stand, such as a table, a chair, or a ladder, that can hold your box at an angle facing the sun.
  - Make your own stand using wood, metal, or PVC pipes, following this example: https://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Food-Dehydrator-Dryer/
  - Attach your box to a wall or a fence that faces south (in North America) or north (in South America), using screws or nails.

5. **Use Your Dehydrator:** You are now ready to use your solar food dehydrator by doing the following:

  - Place your food on the trays in a single layer, leaving some space between them for air circulation. You can dry fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices, meats, and more. For best results, slice your food thinly and evenly, and pre-treat them with lemon juice, vinegar, salt, or spices to prevent browning and spoilage.
  - Place your box on your stand or attach it to your wall or fence, making sure it is facing south (in North America) or north (in South America). Adjust the angle of your box to catch as much sunlight as possible throughout the day.
  - Check your food periodically and rotate your trays if needed to ensure even drying. Depending on your climate and food type, it may take from several hours to several days for your food to dry completely. You can tell when your food is dry when it is brittle, leathery, or crisp, and no moisture is visible when you squeeze or break it.
  - Store your dried food in airtight containers in a cool and dark place. You can also freeze or vacuum-seal your dried food for longer storage.

### Conclusion

A solar food dehydrator is a device used to remove moisture from food using the power of the sun. It can be a great way to preserve food without using electricity or gas, and it can be made with simple materials and tools. By following these steps, you can build your own solar food dehydrator and enjoy dried snacks, herbs, spices, teas, and more.
