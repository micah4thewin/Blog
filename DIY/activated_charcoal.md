# How to Make Activated Charcoal for Prepping and Survival

## Introduction

Activated charcoal is a type of charcoal that has been treated with oxygen to create millions of tiny pores on its surface. These pores increase the surface area of the charcoal and make it highly adsorbent, meaning that it can attract and trap various substances such as toxins, chemicals, gases, and odors.

Activated charcoal has many uses and benefits for prepping and survival. It can be used to purify water, treat poisoning, filter air, deodorize, whiten teeth, make soap, and more. It is also relatively easy and cheap to make at home using some basic materials and methods.

In this guide, you will learn how to make activated charcoal for prepping and survival using two different methods: one with calcium chloride and one with lemon juice.

## Materials and Tools

To make activated charcoal, you will need the following materials and tools:

- Hardwood or coconut shells
- A metal pot with a lid
- A fire source
- A hammer or a mortar and pestle
- A sieve or a cheesecloth
- Calcium chloride or lemon juice
- Water
- A baking sheet or a tray
- An oven

## Method 1: Using Calcium Chloride

Calcium chloride is a chemical compound that can be used to activate charcoal by creating pores on its surface. You can buy calcium chloride online or at your local hardware store.

Here are the steps to make activated charcoal using calcium chloride:

### Step 1: Make Charcoal

The first step is to make charcoal from hardwood or coconut shells. You can use any type of hardwood, such as oak, maple, birch, or hickory. Coconut shells are also a good option because they have a high carbon content and are easy to find.

To make charcoal, you need to burn the wood or shells in a metal pot with a lid over a fire. The lid should have a small hole to allow some air to enter but not enough to cause the material to burn completely. This process is called pyrolysis and it converts the wood or shells into carbon without any ash or smoke.

The burning process can take several hours depending on the size and amount of material you use. You should check the pot occasionally and add more material if needed. When the material stops smoking and turns black, your charcoal is ready.

### Step 2: Powder the Charcoal

The next step is to powder the charcoal using a hammer or a mortar and pestle. You want to crush the charcoal into fine pieces that are no larger than 2 millimeters in diameter. This will increase the surface area of the charcoal and make it easier to activate.

You can also use a blender or a food processor to powder the charcoal, but be careful not to overdo it as this can create dust that can be harmful if inhaled.

### Step 3: Add Calcium Chloride Solution

The third step is to add calcium chloride solution to the powdered charcoal. Calcium chloride solution is made by dissolving calcium chloride crystals in water. You can use any ratio of calcium chloride to water, but a good rule of thumb is to use 25 grams of calcium chloride per 100 milliliters of water.

To add the solution, you need to mix it with the powdered charcoal in a large bowl or container. You want to use enough solution to moisten all the charcoal but not too much that it becomes soggy. The ideal consistency is like wet sand.

### Step 4: Spread on a Sheet

The fourth step is to spread the moistened charcoal on a clean sheet or cheesecloth. You want to spread it evenly and thinly so that it can dry faster and more uniformly. You can use a baking sheet or a tray as your base.

### Step 5: Bake at 250 F for 30 Minutes

The final step is to bake the charcoal at 250 F for 30 minutes or until all moisture is entirely gone. This will activate the charcoal by creating pores on its surface. You can use an oven or any other heat source that can reach this temperature.

After baking, let the charcoal cool down completely before using it or storing it in an airtight container.

## Method 2: Using Lemon Juice

Lemon juice is another natural substance that can be used to activate charcoal by creating pores on its surface. Lemon juice contains citric acid, which reacts with the carbon in the charcoal and forms carbon dioxide gas. This gas creates bubbles and holes on the surface of the charcoal, making it more adsorbent.

Here are the steps to make activated charcoal using lemon juice:

### Step 1: Make Charcoal

The first step is the same as in method 1. You need to make charcoal from hardwood or coconut shells by burning them in a metal pot with a lid over a fire. The lid should have a small hole to allow some air to enter but not enough to cause the material to burn completely. When the material stops smoking and turns black, your charcoal is ready.

### Step 2: Powder the Charcoal

The second step is also the same as in method 1. You need to powder the charcoal using a hammer or a mortar and pestle. You want to crush the charcoal into fine pieces that are no larger than 2 millimeters in diameter.

### Step 3: Add Lemon Juice

The third step is to add lemon juice to the powdered charcoal. Lemon juice is made by squeezing fresh lemons or using bottled lemon juice. You can use any amount of lemon juice, but a good rule of thumb is to use one tablespoon of lemon juice per cup of powdered charcoal.

To add the lemon juice, you need to mix it with the powdered charcoal in a large bowl or container. You want to use enough lemon juice to moisten all the charcoal but not too much that it becomes soggy. The ideal consistency is like wet sand.

### Step 4: Spread on a Sheet

The fourth step is to spread the moistened charcoal on a clean sheet or cheesecloth. You want to spread it evenly and thinly so that it can dry faster and more uniformly. You can use a baking sheet or a tray as your base.

### Step 5: Dry in the Sun for 24 Hours

The final step is to dry the charcoal in the sun for 24 hours or until all moisture is entirely gone. This will activate the charcoal by creating pores on its surface. You can also use an oven or any other heat source that can reach this temperature, but sun drying is more natural and eco-friendly.

After drying, let the charcoal cool down completely before using it or storing it in an airtight container.

## Conclusion

Activated charcoal is a useful substance that has many uses and benefits for prepping and survival. It can be made at home using some basic materials and methods, such as calcium chloride or lemon juice. By following this guide, you can easily make your own activated charcoal for prepping and survival.
