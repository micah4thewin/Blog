# DIY Hunting Traps: A Comprehensive Guide 

Hunting traps come in many shapes and sizes, but the main principle behind all of them is the same—by setting up an inviting area and placing a trap in that space, you can capture your intended prey. Knowing how to build and set up your own hunting traps can save you time and money and even help you to hone your hunting skills. With the right materials, a bit of patience, and this step-by-step guide, you can begin your trapping journey in no time. 

## Basic Hunting Traps 

Traps are used in hunting to catch the prey without the hunter having to be present at the site.  Trapping is often more effective than hunting with a rifle or a bow and arrow, and this is because traps can be set and forgotten, allowing the hunter to roam freely. When the prey enters the trap, it triggers a set of events that ultimately leads to its capture.

### Three Types of Hunting Traps 

There are three basic types of hunting traps—snares, deadfalls, and net traps. 

#### Snares 

A snare is placed over a game trail and is triggered when an animal triggers the snare's doors. The animal is then captured by loops of wire. Snares can be made out of a variety of materials, including but not limited to wire, cable, and even rope. 

#### Deadfalls 

A deadfall is made by placing a heavy, baited, and weighted object—sometimes called a trigger—on top of a game trail. The trigger is made of logs, stones, sticks, or any other heavy material. When an animal attempts to get the bait, they trigger the trigger, which in turn releases the weight onto the prey, killing or capturing them. 

#### Net Traps 

Net trap is built by placing a net across a game trail and is triggered when the animal triggers the net's entrance. It captures the animal so they cannot escape and can then be dispatched/released by the hunter. 

## Parts of a Basic Hunting Trap

Regardless of the type of trap you choose to use, you need a few basic components in order to set it up. The following parts are essential to a successful trap:

* Trap frame 
* Trigger 
* Bait 
* Anchors 

### Trap Frame

The trap frame is the main structure of the trap that will be triggered when an animal trips it. The trap frame is typically made from sticks, poles, wire, cordage, or any other material that can be easily configured to make a box-type frame. 

### Trigger 

The trigger is the piece of the trap that sets off the trap when activated. The trigger is typically a spring loaded object that is set off when pressure is applied to the bait or the frame of the trap. The trigger is usually based on the type of trap you are using, with snares using a spring-loaded door and deadfalls using a weighted object. 

### Bait 

The bait is the lure that the prey is attracted to. The bait can be live bait, such as earthworms or insects, or it can be a piece of food or plant material. 

### Anchors 

Anchors are used to secure the trap and to ensure that the prey is contained within the trap. The anchors can be made from stakes, rocks, roots, and any other material that is strong enough to secure the trap in place.

## Setting Up a Hunting Trap 

Once you have gathered the necessary materials, you are ready to set up your trap. 

### Step 1: Find a Good Location 

The most important part of setting up a trap is finding a good location. Doing your research is key to setting a successful trap, because you need to identify game trails where animals are likely to travel. The area should be someplace that is not easily seen by people and that also meets the legal requirements for trapping in your area. 

### Step 2: Construct Your Trap 

After you have identified a good location, begin constructing your trap. When constructing the trap, make sure that all parts are secure and that all exits are closed off to ensure that the prey cannot escape. 

### Step 3: Place the Bait 

Once the trap is constructed, place the bait inside the trap. Make sure that the bait is placed in the center of the trap and that it is covered or hidden in some way. This makes it more likely that the prey will be attracted to it and enter the trap. 

### Step 4: Secure the Anchors 

Once the bait has been placed, place the anchors around the trap to secure it in place. This ensures that the trap stays in place and does not become unsecured over time.

### Step 5: Set the Trigger 

Finally, set the trigger at the entrance of the trap. The trigger should be placed so that it is easily activated by the prey when they enter the trap.

## Conclusion 

Setting up a hunting trap may seem intimidating at first, but with the right knowledge and the right materials, it is a relatively simple process. With this comprehensive guide, you are now armed with the information you need to begin your trapping journey. All you need to do now is put your newfound knowledge to use and construct your own hunting traps. Good luck!
