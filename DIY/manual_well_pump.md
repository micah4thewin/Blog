# Detailed Guide to Installing a Manual Well Pump

A manual well pump is an efficient way to draw water from a well and can be used in the absence of access to electricity. Installing a manual well pump is a relatively straightforward but time-intensive task, but when done correctly, it can provide a reliable water source for years to come.

## Materials & Supplies

Before starting the installation process, make sure you have the required materials and tools available. The exact supplies may vary based on the specifics of your well and the pump for which you are installing, but some of the most common supplies required are listed below:

* Well casing & seal/gasket
* Well cylinder/straw
* Outlet pipe
* Suitable outlet pipe material
* Manual pump (including plunger & associated parts)
* Well pump handle (drive arm)
* Priming container & sealant
* Water testing kit

## Steps to Install a Manual Well Pump

1. Locate the well casing & mark its dimensions in order to ensure you purchase the right size pump for the well opening.

2. Secure the well casing in place using a seal/gasket and use the associated wrench to tighten it up.

3. Measure and cut the appropriate size of well cylinder/straw for the pump. Cut it to the necessary length to ensure a snug fit when inserted into the well casing.

4. Insert the well cylinder/straw into the well casing and secure it in place using a seal/gasket.

5. Measure the outlet pipe required and cut it to the appropriate length using the appropriate material (e.g. metal or plastic).

6. Attach the outlet pipe to the well casing using a seal/gasket.

7. Attach the manual pump to the outlet pipe using the plunger and associated parts.

8. Secure the well pump handle (drive arm) to the pump.

9. Connect the outlet pipe to an appropriate water source, if necessary.

10. Prime the pump and check for any leaks using a priming container & sealant.

11. Test the water from the pump using a water testing kit.

Once all of these steps are complete the manual well pump should be installed and ready to go.
