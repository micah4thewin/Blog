# Detailed Guide to Installing a Manual Well Pump

A manual well pump is an efficient way to draw water from a well and can be used in the absence of access to electricity. Installing a manual well pump is a relatively straightforward but time-intensive task, but when done correctly, it can provide a reliable water source for years to come.

## Materials & Supplies

Before starting the installation process, make sure you have the required materials and tools available. The exact supplies may vary based on the specifics of your well and the pump for which you are installing, but some of the most common supplies required are listed below:

* **Well casing & seal/gasket**: The well casing is the outermost layer of the well that protects it from contamination and damage. The seal/gasket is used to create a tight connection between the well casing and the other parts of the pump.
* **Well cylinder/straw**: The well cylinder/straw is the innermost layer of the well that contains the water. It is usually made of metal or plastic and has holes or slots to allow water to enter.
* **Outlet pipe**: The outlet pipe is the pipe that connects the well cylinder/straw to the manual pump. It allows water to flow from the well to the pump.
* **Suitable outlet pipe material**: The outlet pipe material should be compatible with the type of water in your well and the climate in your area. For example, metal pipes may corrode or freeze in certain conditions, while plastic pipes may crack or melt in high temperatures.
* **Manual pump (including plunger & associated parts)**: The manual pump is the device that draws water from the well using human power. It consists of a plunger that moves up and down inside a cylinder, creating suction and pressure that forces water through the outlet pipe. The associated parts include valves, seals, springs, rods, etc. that help regulate the flow and direction of water.
* **Well pump handle (drive arm)**: The well pump handle (drive arm) is the part that you use to operate the manual pump. It is attached to the plunger and allows you to move it up and down.
* **Priming container & sealant**: The priming container & sealant are used to fill the pump with water before using it for the first time or after a long period of disuse. This helps remove any air bubbles from the pump and ensures a smooth and consistent flow of water. The priming container can be any container that can hold water, such as a bucket or a jug. The sealant can be any substance that can create an airtight seal around the outlet pipe, such as plumber's putty or silicone caulk.
* **Water testing kit**: The water testing kit is used to check the quality and safety of the water from your well. It can measure various parameters such as pH, hardness, iron, bacteria, etc. and indicate whether your water is suitable for drinking or other purposes.

## Steps to Install a Manual Well Pump

1. Locate the well casing & mark its dimensions in order to ensure you purchase the right size pump for the well opening.

    * Use a tape measure or a ruler to measure the diameter and depth of your well casing.
    * Compare your measurements with the specifications of different pumps available in the market and choose one that fits your well opening.
    * Mark the location and size of your well casing on the ground using chalk or spray paint.

2. Secure the well casing in place using a seal/gasket and use the associated wrench to tighten it up.

    * Place the seal/gasket over the top of your well casing and align it with the opening.
    * Place the pump over the seal/gasket and align it with the opening as well.
    * Use the associated wrench to tighten up the bolts or screws that hold the pump and seal/gasket in place.

3. Measure and cut the appropriate size of well cylinder/straw for
the pump. Cut it to
the necessary length to ensure a snug fit when inserted into
the well casing.

    * Use a tape measure or a ruler to measure
the length of your well cylinder/straw according
to
the instructions provided by
the manufacturer of your pump.
    * Use a hacksaw or a pipe cutter
to cut
the well cylinder/straw
to
the desired length.
    * Make sure
the edges of
the cut are smooth and free of burrs.

4. Insert
the well cylinder/straw into
the well casing and secure it in place using a seal/gasket.

    * Apply some lubricant such as petroleum jelly or grease
to
the end of
the well cylinder/straw
that will go into
the well casing.
    * Carefully lower
the well cylinder/straw into
the well casing until it reaches
the bottom of
the well or
the desired depth.
    * Place another seal/gasket over
the top of
the well cylinder/straw and align it with
the opening of
the pump.

5. Measure the outlet pipe required and cut it to the appropriate length using the appropriate material (e.g. metal or plastic).

    * Use a tape measure or a ruler to measure the distance from the pump to the point where you want the water to come out, such as a faucet, a hose, or a storage tank.
    * Add some extra length to account for bends and curves in the pipe.
    * Use a hacksaw or a pipe cutter to cut the outlet pipe to the required length.
    * Make sure the edges of the cut are smooth and free of burrs.

6. Attach the outlet pipe to the well casing using a seal/gasket.

    * Apply some sealant such as plumber's putty or silicone caulk around the end of the outlet pipe that will connect to the pump.
    * Insert the outlet pipe into the opening of the pump and secure it in place using a seal/gasket and the associated wrench.

7. Attach the manual pump to the outlet pipe using the plunger and associated parts.

    * Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer of your pump to assemble the plunger and associated parts.
    * Insert the plunger into the outlet pipe and attach it to the pump using bolts, screws, nuts, etc.
    * Make sure all the connections are tight and secure.

8. Secure the well pump handle (drive arm) to the pump.

    * Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer of your pump to attach the well pump handle (drive arm) to the plunger.
    * Use bolts, screws, nuts, etc. to secure the handle in place.
    * Make sure all the connections are tight and secure.

9. Connect the outlet pipe to an appropriate water source, if necessary.

    * If you want to use your manual well pump as a backup or emergency water source, you may want to connect it to an existing water system, such as a municipal water supply or a rainwater harvesting system.
    * To do this, you will need a valve that can switch between different water sources and a check valve that can prevent backflow of water into your well.
    * Follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer of your valve and check valve to install them on your outlet pipe and connect them to your desired water source.

10. Prime the pump and check for any leaks using a priming container & sealant.

    * Fill your priming container with clean water and pour it into the opening of your pump until it is full.
    * Move the well pump handle (drive arm) up and down several times until you see water coming out of your outlet pipe.
    * Check for any leaks around your pump, well casing, well cylinder/straw, and outlet pipe. If you find any leaks, use more sealant or tighten up any loose connections.

11. Test
the water from
the pump using a water testing kit.

    * Collect some water from your outlet pipe in a clean container and use your water testing kit
to measure various parameters such as pH, hardness, iron, bacteria, etc.
    * Compare your results with
the recommended standards for drinking water or other purposes.
    * If your water does not meet
the standards, you may need
to treat it with filters, disinfectants, softeners, etc. before using it.

Once all of these steps are complete,
the manual well pump should be installed and ready
to go.'
