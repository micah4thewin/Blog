## Homemade Toothpaste Guide

Making your own toothpaste may seem a daunting task, but with the help of this guide, you'll be able to craft your own toothpaste with ease. Here, we'll cover the materials you'll need, the process of making your own toothpaste, and tips for storage and use.

### Materials Needed

Before you begin, make sure you have these materials on hand:

- Â½ tsp. of baking soda
- 2 tsp. of coconut oil
- 7 - 10 drops of peppermint essential oil
- Small container with a lid

Baking soda is a natural abrasive that helps remove plaque and stains from your teeth. It also neutralizes acids and balances the pH of your mouth[^1^][1].

Coconut oil is a natural antibacterial and antifungal agent that helps prevent tooth decay and gum disease. It also moisturizes your mouth and gives your toothpaste a smooth texture[^2^][2].

Peppermint essential oil is a natural flavoring that gives your toothpaste a fresh and minty taste. It also has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that help fight bad breath and soothe your gums[^3^][3].

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Making your own homemade toothpaste is as easy as following these steps:

1) **Start by measuring the baking soda into a bowl** and then stir in the coconut oil.

2) **Once the baking soda and oil have been thoroughly mixed**, add the essential oil and mix again.

3) **Once you've mixed all the ingredients together**, spoon it into the empty container.

4) **Seal the container** and store it in a cool, dark place.

### Tips & Tricks

Now that you've made your own toothpaste, here are a few tips to ensure the longest shelf-life and best experience when using it:

- Make sure to stir the toothpaste immediately before use to ensure the ingredients are well-mixed.
- Consider adding 1-2 more drops of peppermint essential oil if the flavor of the toothpaste isn't strong enough for you.
- Make sure to choose a container with an air tight seal to preserve the toothpaste and keep out any unwanted moisture or bacteria.
- Replace your homemade toothpaste every month or so, as the shelf-life is shorter than store-bought toothpaste.

### Conclusion

Making your own toothpaste isn't hard, it's just a matter of gathering the right materials and following a few simple instructions. Plus, it's cheaper and has fewer potentially harmful chemicals than store-bought toothpastes. Enjoy!
