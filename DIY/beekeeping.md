# Beekeeping Guide

Beekeeping can be a fascinating hobby, a profitable sideline, or a full-time occupation. Bees are essential for pollinating many crops and plants, and they produce honey and other products that you can harvest and enjoy. However, beekeeping also requires some knowledge, skills, and equipment to be successful and safe. This guide will provide you with the basics of beekeeping, from choosing a hive system to managing your bees throughout the year.

## Beekeeping Basics

Before you start beekeeping, you should learn as much as you can about bees and their behavior. Bees are social insects that live in colonies consisting of a queen, workers, and drones. The queen is the only fertile female in the colony and lays all the eggs. The workers are sterile females that perform various tasks such as foraging, cleaning, feeding, and defending the hive. The drones are males that mate with new queens and die afterwards.

Bees communicate with each other through pheromones (chemical signals) and dances (movements) to convey information such as the location and quality of food sources, the presence of enemies, and the condition of the colony. Bees also regulate the temperature and humidity of the hive by fanning their wings, clustering together, or evaporating water.

Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowers and bring them back to the hive. Nectar is a sugary liquid that bees convert into honey by adding enzymes and reducing the moisture content. Honey is stored in wax cells called honeycombs that bees build from glands on their abdomen. Pollen is a protein-rich powder that bees mix with nectar and store in special cells called pollen baskets. Pollen is used to feed the developing larvae (baby bees).

Bees have a complex life cycle that involves four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The queen lays one egg per cell in the brood chamber (the part of the hive where the young bees are raised). The egg hatches into a larva after three days and is fed by nurse bees until it spins a cocoon and becomes a pupa. The pupa develops into an adult bee after about two weeks (depending on the type of bee). The adult bee emerges from the cell and joins the rest of the colony.

Bees face many threats from pests, diseases, predators, and environmental factors. Some of the common pests and diseases that affect bees are varroa mites, nosema, American foulbrood, European foulbrood, chalkbrood, wax moths, hive beetles, tracheal mites, deformed wing virus, and colony collapse disorder. Some of the common predators that attack bees are bears, skunks, raccoons, mice, birds, wasps, hornets, ants, spiders, and humans. Some of the environmental factors that affect bees are weather, climate change, pesticides, herbicides, pollution, habitat loss, and competition.

## Beekeeping Equipment

To keep bees, you need some basic equipment that will allow you to house, handle, and harvest your bees safely and efficiently. Here is a list of some essential items that you will need:

- Hive: A hive is a man-made structure that provides shelter and space for your bees to build their comb and store their honey. There are different types of hives that vary in design and size. The most common type is the Langstroth hive, which consists of wooden boxes stacked on top of each other. Each box contains frames that hold sheets of wax or plastic foundation where the bees build their comb. You can add or remove boxes depending on the needs of your colony. Another type is the top-bar hive,
which consists of wooden bars arranged horizontally in a long box. The bees build their comb without foundation on each bar. You can access the bars by lifting them from the top of the box.

- Hive stand: A hive stand is a platform or base that elevates your hive off the ground. This helps prevent moisture buildup, rotting, pest invasion,
and flooding in your hive. You can use wooden blocks,
metal legs,
or concrete blocks
as hive stands.

- Hive tool: A hive tool is a metal device that helps you pry apart frames,
boxes,
and covers
that are stuck together by propolis (a sticky substance that bees use to seal cracks
and gaps
in the hive). It also helps you scrape off excess wax and propolis from the hive. It also helps you lift and hold frames. You can use this one.

- Bee suit: A bee suit is a protective clothing that covers your body from head to toe. It prevents bees from stinging you and getting into your hair or clothes. Some bee suits are ventilated to keep you cool in hot weather. You can choose from different sizes and styles to fit your preference. This is one of the bee suits that I recommend.

- Gloves: Gloves are another protective item that shield your hands from bee stings. They are usually made of leather or rubber and have long cuffs that cover your wrists. Some beekeepers prefer not to wear gloves because they feel they have more control and sensitivity without them, but this is a personal choice. These are some gloves that you can try.

- Veil: A veil is a mesh screen that covers your face and neck. It protects your eyes, nose, mouth, and ears from bee stings and allows you to see clearly. Some veils are attached to hats or helmets, while others are integrated with bee suits or jackets. You can also use a simple cloth or scarf as a veil, but make sure it is secured tightly around your head. Here is an example of a veil.

- Smoker: A smoker is a device that produces smoke from burning fuel such as pine needles, wood shavings, cardboard, or cotton. Smoke calms the bees by masking their alarm pheromones and making them think there is a fire nearby. This makes them less defensive and more focused on eating honey to prepare for evacuation. You can use a smoker to inspect your hive, harvest honey, or introduce new bees. This is one of the smokers that I use.

- Feeder: A feeder is a container that holds sugar syrup, water, or pollen substitute for your bees. You can use a feeder to supplement your bees' diet when natural food sources are scarce or insufficient, such as in winter, spring, or drought. There are different types of feeders that you can place inside or outside the hive, such as entrance feeders, frame feeders, top feeders, or bucket feeders. This is an example of a feeder.

- Extractor: An extractor is a machine that spins honey frames and extracts honey by centrifugal force. You can use an extractor to harvest honey from your hive without damaging the comb. Extractors can be manual or electric, and they can hold different numbers of frames depending on their size. You can buy an extractor or rent one from a local beekeeping association or store. This is an example of an extractor.

- Uncapping knife: An uncapping knife is a tool that removes the wax cappings from the honey cells before extraction. You can use a heated electric knife or a cold serrated knife to cut along the surface of the comb and expose the honey. You can also use an uncapping fork or roller to pierce or scratch the cappings instead of cutting them. This is an example of an uncapping knife.

- Strainer: A strainer is a device that filters out wax particles, propolis, dead bees, and other debris from the extracted honey. You can use a strainer to clean your honey and make it ready for bottling or consumption. Strainers can be made of cloth, nylon, or stainless steel mesh, and they can have different pore sizes depending on how fine you want your honey to be. This is an example of a strainer.

- Bottling equipment: Bottling equipment includes containers, lids, labels, and dispensers that you use to store and sell your honey. You can choose from different shapes, sizes, and materials for your honey bottles or containers. You can use glass or plastic jars, squeeze bottles, bears, or other shapes. You can also use labels to customize your honey with your name, logo, or information. You can use a bottling bucket with a honey gate or a bottling tank and filler to dispense your honey into the containers. These are some examples of bottling equipment.

## How to Start with Bees

Once you have your equipment ready, you need to get your bees. There are different ways to obtain bees for your hive, such as:

- Ordering package bees: Package bees are a box of bees that contain a queen and several thousand workers. They are usually shipped by mail or picked up from a local supplier in spring. You can order package bees online or from a beekeeping catalog. You need to install the package bees into your hive by shaking them into the box and releasing the queen from her cage.

- Ordering nucs: Nucs are short for nucleus colonies, which are small colonies that consist of a queen and a few frames of brood and honey. They are usually sold by local beekeepers or beekeeping associations in spring or summer. You can order nucs online or from a beekeeping club. You need to transfer the nuc frames into your hive and add more frames to fill the box.

- Catching a swarm: A swarm is a cluster of bees that have left their original hive in search of a new home. They are usually found hanging from a tree branch or other structure in spring or summer. You can catch a swarm by placing a box or a bucket under it and shaking it gently until the bees fall into it. You need to transfer the swarm into your hive and feed them sugar syrup until they settle down.

- Buying an established hive: An established hive is a hive that has been managed by another beekeeper for at least one season. It has a queen and several boxes of brood and honey. It is usually sold by local beekeepers who want to reduce their hive numbers or quit beekeeping. You can buy an established hive online or from a beekeeping classified ad. You need to transport the hive carefully to your location and inspect it for any problems.

## Hive Management

Hive management is the process of taking care of your bees throughout the year. It involves inspecting, feeding, treating, harvesting, and preparing your hive for different seasons and situations. Here are some general guidelines for hive management:

- Inspecting: You should inspect your hive regularly to check the health and productivity of your colony. You should look for signs of pests, diseases, swarming, robbing, starvation, queenlessness, and other issues. You should also monitor the brood pattern, honey stores, pollen availability, and population size of your colony. You should inspect your hive every 7 to 10 days in spring and summer, every 2 to 4 weeks in fall, and every 1 to 2 months in winter.

- Feeding: You should feed your bees when they do not have enough natural food sources such as nectar and pollen. You should feed them sugar syrup (a mixture of sugar and water) to provide them with carbohydrates, and pollen substitute (a mixture of soy flour, brewer's yeast, and vitamins) to provide them with protein. You should feed them sugar syrup in spring to stimulate brood rearing, in fall to help them store honey for winter, and in winter to prevent starvation. You should feed them pollen substitute in late winter to early spring to boost their nutrition.

- Treating: You should treat your bees for pests and diseases when they show symptoms or when you detect high levels of infestation or infection. You should use approved treatments that are effective and safe for your bees and the environment. You should follow the instructions and precautions on the label carefully and apply the treatments at the right time and dosage. Some of the common treatments for varroa mites are Apivar, Apiguard, Hopguard, Formic acid, and Oxalic acid[^1^][1].

- Harvesting: You should harvest your honey when the honey flow (the period when nectar is abundant) is over and the honey cells are capped by the bees. You should leave enough honey for your bees to survive the winter (about 40 to 60 pounds). You should use a bee escape or a fume board to clear the bees from the honey supers before you remove them. You should uncap the honey cells with an uncapping knife or fork and extract the honey with an extractor. You should strain and bottle the honey with a strainer and bottling equipment.

- Preparing: You should prepare your hive for different seasons and situations by adjusting the hive configuration, ventilation, insulation, and protection. You should add or remove boxes depending on the colony size and honey production. You should provide adequate ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and overheating. You should insulate your hive to keep it warm in winter and cool in summer. You should protect your hive from predators, pests, wind, snow, and other hazards.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some tips and tricks to help you with your beekeeping:

- Use frames with foundation or foundationless frames to give your bees a guide to build their comb. Frames make it easier to inspect, manage, and harvest your hive[^1^][2].
- Use one size of boxes and frames for both brood and honey. This simplifies your equipment and allows you to interchange frames between boxes[^1^][2].
- Use a smoker to calm your bees before and during a hive inspection. Smoke masks the alarm pheromones of the bees and makes them less defensive. Use natural fuels such as pine needles, wood shavings, or cardboard for your smoker[^1^][2].
- Wear protective clothing such as a bee suit, gloves, and veil to prevent bee stings. Choose clothing that is light-colored, well-fitting, and ventilated. Avoid wearing perfumes, colognes, or scented products that may attract or irritate bees[^2^][3].
- Inspect your hive regularly to check for signs of pests, diseases, swarming, queenlessness, and other issues. Inspect your hive every 7 to 10 days in spring and summer, every 2 to 4 weeks in fall, and every 1 to 2 months in winter[^2^][3].
- Feed your bees when they do not have enough natural food sources such as nectar and pollen. Feed them sugar syrup to provide them with carbohydrates, and pollen substitute to provide them with protein. Feed them sugar syrup in spring to stimulate brood rearing, in fall to help them store honey for winter, and in winter to prevent starvation. Feed them pollen substitute in late winter to early spring to boost their nutrition[^2^][3].
- Treat your bees for pests and diseases when they show symptoms or when you detect high levels of infestation or infection. Use approved treatments that are effective and safe for your bees and the environment. Follow the instructions and precautions on the label carefully and apply the treatments at the right time and dosage. Some of the common treatments for varroa mites are Apivar, Apiguard, Hopguard, Formic acid, and Oxalic acid[^3^][1].
- Harvest your honey when the honey flow (the period when nectar is abundant) is over and the honey cells are capped by the bees. Leave enough honey for your bees to survive the winter (about 40 to 60 pounds). Use a bee escape or a fume board to clear the bees from the honey supers before you remove them. Uncap the honey cells with an uncapping knife or fork and extract the honey with an extractor. Strain and bottle the honey with a strainer and bottling equipment[^4^][4].
- Prepare your hive for different seasons and situations by adjusting the hive configuration, ventilation, insulation, and protection. Add or remove boxes depending on the colony size and honey production. Provide adequate ventilation to prevent moisture buildup and overheating. Insulate your hive to keep it warm in winter and cool in summer. Protect your hive from predators, pests, wind, snow, and other hazards[^4^][4].


## Problems and Solutions

Beekeeping is not without its challenges and problems. You may encounter various issues that affect your bees' health, productivity, and survival. Here are some common problems and solutions that you may face as a beekeeper:

- Swarming: Swarming is a natural phenomenon where a colony splits into two and one half leaves the hive with the old queen in search of a new home. Swarming reduces your colony size and honey production. To prevent swarming, you should provide enough space for your bees by adding more boxes or frames. You should also inspect your hive regularly for swarm cells (queen cells that indicate swarming intentions) and remove them. You should also requeen your hive every year or two with a young and productive queen[^1^][2].
- Robbing: Robbing is a situation where bees from another colony invade your hive and steal honey. Robbing can weaken your colony and cause fighting and stress among your bees. To prevent robbing, you should reduce the entrance size of your hive to make it easier for your bees to defend it. You should also avoid feeding your bees sugar syrup or honey in open feeders that may attract other bees. You should also avoid spilling honey or syrup around your hive or apiary[^1^][2].
- Varroa mites: Varroa mites are parasitic mites that feed on the blood of bees and transmit viruses. Varroa mites can cause deformities, diseases, and death in bees. To control varroa mites, you should monitor their population by using sticky boards, sugar rolls, or alcohol washes. You should also use approved treatments such as Apivar, Apiguard, Hopguard, Formic acid, or Oxalic acid[^2^][1]. You should also use drone brood trapping or screen bottom boards to reduce the mite reproduction[^1^][2].
- American foulbrood: American foulbrood (AFB) is a bacterial disease that infects the brood and kills them. AFB can spread quickly and wipe out an entire colony. To prevent AFB, you should inspect your hive regularly for signs of infection such as sunken and perforated cappings, foul odor, ropy larvae, and scales. You should also avoid using equipment or tools from infected hives without sterilizing them. If you detect AFB in your hive, you should report it to your local bee inspector and destroy the infected hive by burning it.
- Chalkbrood: Chalkbrood is a fungal disease that affects the brood and turns them into hard chalky mummies. Chalkbrood can reduce the population and growth of your colony. To prevent chalkbrood, you should provide adequate ventilation and insulation to your hive to prevent moisture and temperature fluctuations. You should also replace old and dark combs with new ones to reduce the spore load. You should also requeen your hive with a hygienic and resistant stock[^1^][5].
- Nosema: Nosema is a fungal disease that infects the gut of bees and causes diarrhea, dysentery, and reduced lifespan. Nosema can weaken your colony and affect its winter survival. To prevent nosema, you should avoid feeding your bees sugar syrup in late fall or winter as this may increase their need to defecate. You should also provide adequate ventilation to your hive to prevent condensation and mold. You should also treat your bees with Fumagilin-B, a medication that inhibits the growth of nosema.
- Wax moths: Wax moths are insects that lay eggs in the comb and feed on the wax and pollen. Wax moths can damage your comb and contaminate your honey. To prevent wax moths, you should keep your colony strong and populous as they can defend their hive from wax moth invasion. You should also remove any empty or unused combs from your hive or store them in a freezer or a sealed container with paradichlorobenzene crystals[^2^][2].
- Hive beetles: Hive beetles are small black beetles that invade hives and feed on pollen, honey, brood, and beeswax. Hive beetles can cause fermentation, spoilage, and sliming of honey and comb. To prevent hive beetles, you should keep your colony strong and populous as they can chase away or trap the beetles in propolis. You should also reduce the entrance size of your hive to make it easier for your bees to guard it. You should also use traps or baits to catch or kill the beetles[^2^][2].
- Bears: Bears are large mammals that can raid hives and destroy them in search of honey and brood. Bears can cause severe damage and loss to your beekeeping operation. To prevent bears, you should use electric fences around your apiary to deter them. You should also use metal straps or wires to secure your hive boxes together and to the hive stand. You should also use bear-resistant containers or sheds to store your honey or equipment[^2^][2].

These are some of the common problems and solutions that you may encounter as a beekeeper. However, there may be other issues that are specific to your location, climate, or situation. Therefore, you should always be alert and observant of your bees' behavior and condition, and seek help from other beekeepers or experts when needed.

## How to Build a Beehive from Scratch

If you want to build a beehive from scratch, you need to have some woodworking skills and tools, as well as some patience and creativity. You can choose from different types of beehives, such as Langstroth, top-bar, or Warre, depending on your preference and budget. Here are some general steps to build a beehive from scratch:

- Choose a beehive plan or style: You can find many free or paid beehive plans online or in books that provide detailed instructions and measurements for building a beehive. You can also design your own beehive based on your needs and specifications. Some factors to consider when choosing a beehive plan or style are the size, shape, weight, cost, ease of use, and honey production of the hive.
- Gather your materials: You need to have some basic materials to build a beehive, such as wood boards, plywood sheets, nails, screws, wood glue, hinges, latches, metal hardware, paint or stain, and protective gear. You also need some tools to cut, drill, measure, and assemble the hive parts, such as a table saw, a miter saw, a drill, a hammer, a tape measure, a carpenter's square, a level, a pencil, and clamps. You can buy these materials and tools from a hardware store or online.
- Cut out materials following directions: You need to follow the directions of your beehive plan or style carefully and cut out the materials according to the measurements and specifications. You need to make sure that the cuts are accurate and precise to ensure a good fit and alignment of the hive parts. You also need to mark the parts with labels or numbers to avoid confusion later.
and wood glue. You need to follow the instructions of your beehive plan or style and assemble the parts in the right order and position. You need to make sure that the parts are aligned and secured properly to ensure a sturdy and stable hive. You also need to use a carpenter's square to check the squareness of the hive parts and adjust them if needed.
- Purchase frames, wax foundation or any parts that you chose not to build: You need to have frames and foundation for your beehive, as these are the parts where the bees will build their comb and store their honey and brood. You can buy ready-made frames and foundation from a beekeeping supply store or online, or you can make your own if you have the skills and tools. You also need to buy any other parts that you chose not to build, such as a bottom board, a cover, a feeder, or a queen excluder.
- Paint your beehive with exterior latex paint to preserve the wood: You need to paint your beehive with exterior latex paint to protect it from weather and moisture damage. You can choose any color you like, but avoid dark colors that may overheat your hive in summer. You should paint only the outside of the hive and leave the inside unpainted to avoid harming your bees. You should also avoid painting over any metal hardware or joints that may rust or stick together.

These are some general steps to build a beehive from scratch. However, there may be some variations depending on the type of beehive you choose and the design of your plan or style. Therefore, you should always follow the specific instructions of your beehive plan or style and consult with other beekeepers or experts if you have any questions or doubts.
- Assemble parts with nails, screws, and wood glue: You need to assemble the hive parts with nails, screws,
