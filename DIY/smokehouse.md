the vents on
the doors and walls of
your smokehouse to allow enough air flow for
the fire and
the smoke. You can open or close
the vents as needed to control
the temperature and
the amount of smoke inside
your smokehouse.
- **Start Smoking Your Food:** Start smoking your food by placing it on
the trays of
your smokehouse in
a single layer, leaving some space between them for air circulation. You can smoke fruits,
vegetables,
herbs,
spices,
meats,
