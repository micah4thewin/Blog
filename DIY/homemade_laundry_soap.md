# Introduction to Homemade Laundry Soap
Do you want to save money, reduce harsh chemicals, or switch to more eco-friendly products in your home? Making your own laundry soap might be the solution you’re looking for. This guide will teach you everything you need to know for making a simple, inexpensive, and effective homemade laundry soap. 

## What You'll Need 
Making your own laundry soap doesn’t require many special ingredients or tools. You’ll need the following ingredients:

* Approximately 2 cups of **baking soda** for cleaning and removing odors 
* Approximately 1 cup of **washing soda** to help break down dirt and oil
* Approximately 1 cup of **borax**, which is a natural mineral with disinfectant properties
* A few tablespoons of **casts oil** for its antifungal and antibacterial properties 
 
You’ll also need the following equipment:

*An empty container with a lid to store the soap
*A large bowl
*A spoon or whisk 
 
## Preparing Your Ingredients
Before mixing your ingredients, make sure they’re all in a dry form. You can add the baking soda, washing soda, and borax into the bowl to mix them together. Once you’ve added them, use the spoon or whisk to mix everything together.

Once this is done, add the castor oil to the mix, start with a few tablespoons. If you need more, add it slowly and mix until you achieve your desired consistency. Keep in mind that your soap should be dry and not oily for it to be effective. 

## Store the Laundry Soap
Once you’ve achieved the desired consistency, your laundry soap is ready to store. Pour the final mix into the storage container and secure the lid tightly. Make sure to store it in a cool and dry place.

## Using the Laundry Soap 
When using your laundry soap, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, always use cold water when washing delicate fabrics, as using hot water can cause damage. Second, use one tablespoon of soap for every small load, and around two tablespoons for a large load. 

Third, if you happen to see any clumps or residue in the washing machine, simply take out the clothes and strain them through a colander to check for any clumps. If there are any, use your fingers to break them up before starting the load again. 

## Troubleshooting 
Making your own laundry soap doesn’t come without its challenges. Here is a list of some of the most common issues you may encounter, and how to resolve them:

### Excess Soap Residue 
If you’ve noticed that your clothes have excess soap residue after the cycle has finished, you’ll need to decrease the amount of soap used for the next cycle. 

### Clots of Soap
If the soap isn’t draining out properly, make sure to break up any clumps before starting the cycle again. 
 
### Clothes are Not Getting Clean
If you feel like the clothes are still dirty after washing, add a few extra tablespoons of soap to the next cycle to hopefully achieve a better cleaning result. 

## Conclusion
Making your own laundry soap not only saves you money, but also reduces your exposure to harsh chemicals. Once you get the hang of making your own soap, you’ll never have to buy laundry soap ever again.
 
Follow this guide, pay attention to the steps, and you'll have laundry soap that's just right for you.  Good luck!
