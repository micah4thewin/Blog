## Introduction to Homemade Laundry Soap

Do you want to save money, reduce harsh chemicals, or switch to more eco-friendly products in your home? Making your own laundry soap might be the solution you’re looking for. This guide will teach you everything you need to know for making a simple, inexpensive, and effective homemade laundry soap.

### What You'll Need

Making your own laundry soap doesn’t require many special ingredients or tools. You’ll need the following ingredients:

- Approximately 2 cups of **baking soda** for cleaning and removing odors
- Approximately 1 cup of **washing soda** to help break down dirt and oil
- Approximately 1 cup of **borax**, which is a natural mineral with disinfectant properties
- A few tablespoons of **castile soap** for its antifungal and antibacterial properties

Baking soda is a natural abrasive that helps remove plaque and stains from your clothes. It also neutralizes acids and balances the pH of your mouth[^1^][1].

Washing soda is a chemical compound that helps soften water and boost the cleaning power of the soap. It also helps remove grease and oil stains from fabrics[^2^][2].

Borax is a natural mineral that has disinfectant and deodorizing properties. It also helps brighten colors and whiten whites[^3^][3].

Castile soap is a vegetable-based soap that is gentle and biodegradable. It also helps create suds and remove dirt and grime from clothes[^4^][4].

You’ll also need the following equipment:

- An empty container with a lid to store the soap
- A large bowl
- A spoon or whisk

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Making your own homemade laundry soap is as easy as following these steps:

1) **Start by measuring the baking soda, washing soda, and borax into a bowl** and then stir them together.

2) **Once the dry ingredients have been thoroughly mixed**, add the castile soap and mix again.

3) **Once you've mixed all the ingredients together**, transfer them to the empty container.

4) **Seal the container** and store it in a cool, dry place.

### Tips & Tricks

Now that you've made your own laundry soap, here are a few tips to ensure the longest shelf-life and best experience when using it:

- Make sure to shake or stir the soap before each use to ensure the ingredients are well-mixed.
- Use about 2 tablespoons of soap per load of laundry, depending on the size and soil level of your clothes.
- If you have hard water, you may need to add more soap or use vinegar as a natural fabric softener to prevent buildup on your clothes.
- If you want to add fragrance to your laundry soap, you can add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to the mix.

### Conclusion

Making your own laundry soap not only saves you money, but also reduces your exposure to harsh chemicals. Once you get the hang of making your own soap, you’ll never have to buy laundry soap ever again.

Follow this guide, pay attention to the steps, and you'll have laundry soap that's just right for you. Good luck!
