Making bar soap at home is an inexpensive and creative hobby that lets you customize your soap with different colors, scents, and additives like oatmeal, vanilla, or lavender. In this guide, we’ll cover the materials and supplies needed for this fun craft and provide step-by-step instructions for making homemade soap, including safety tips for working with lye, curing, and storing. 

## What You’ll Need

Before you begin making your own handmade soap, you’ll need to assemble a few materials and supplies. Here’s the list of everything you’ll need:

- Bar soap molds 
- Gloves
- Safety goggles
- Cheesecloth
- Digital kitchen scale
- Liquid measuring cup
- Heat-safe container
- Mixing utensil
- Apron
- Lye
- Base oils 
- Your choice of coloring, fragrance, essential oils, and other additives 

You can find most of these items at craft and hobby stores, or online retailers. It’s important to make sure you use the digital scale for measuring ingredients, as it gives you the most accurate results.

## Working with Lye

The key ingredient in handmade soap is lye, also known as sodium hydroxide. This is a caustic substance used to create saponification, which converts oils into soap. When handling lye, it’s important to take safety precautions. Wear gloves, safety goggles, and an apron at all times. Working in a well-ventilated room is helpful, as lye produces fumes that can be hazardous if inhaled. 

When preparing lye for your soap-making project, you’ll want to create a lye solution. To do this, mix the lye with three times its weight of distilled water in the heat-safe container.  Stir the solution with your mixing utensil until the lye has completely dissolved, then set aside to cool. 

## Making the Soap

Once you’ve created your lye solution and gathered your other supplies, you’re ready to start making soap. 

1. Measure the base oils needed for your recipe using the digital scale. Pour the oils into the heat-safe container. 
2. Heat your oils in the microwave or a double boiler until they reach a temperature of 115-120°F. 
3. Carefully add the lye solution to the melted oils. 
4. Stir the ingredients with a mixing utensil until the mixture reaches a light trace. To test the trace, dribble some soap onto the surface. It’s ready when the liquid drizzles in a thin stream. 
5. Add any colorings, fragrances, essential oils, or other additives to the mixture. Stir until everything is fully incorporated. 
6. Pour the soap batter into the molds and cover with cheesecloth to prevent the soap from forming a crust on the surface.
7. Allow the soap to remain in the molds for 12-24 hours. 

## Curing and Storing

Once you’ve unmolded the soap, it needs to cure for 4-6 weeks. Place your soaps in an area with good air circulation that’s away from direct sunlight. During this time, you’ll want to monitor your soap for any signs of discoloration or spoilage, such as mold or a rancid odor. If anything looks off, discard the soap.

Once the curing process is complete, your soap is ready for use. To keep your soap in good condition, store it in a cool, dry place. If you’ve made decorative soaps that you won’t be using soon, consider wrapping them in cheesecloth to protect them from dust and other contaminants.
