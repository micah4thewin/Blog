# DIY Compost Bin: A Comprehensive Guide

A compost bin is a container that is used to store and process organic waste, such as food scraps, yard trimmings, paper, etc. Composting is a natural process that transforms organic waste into a nutrient-rich soil amendment called compost. Compost can be used to improve the quality and fertility of your garden soil, as well as reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills. In this guide, weâ€™ll show you how to make your own compost bin using simple and inexpensive materials.

## Materials Needed

To make a DIY compost bin, you will need the following materials:

- **Plastic storage bin**: The plastic storage bin will serve as the main container for your compost bin. You will need a bin that is large enough to hold your desired amount of organic waste, has a tight-fitting lid, and has ventilation holes or slots. You can use any type of plastic storage bin that meets these criteria, such as a trash can, a tote box, or a bucket.
- **Drill**: The drill will be used to make holes or slots in the plastic storage bin for ventilation and drainage. You will need a drill that can pierce through plastic and has various drill bits for different sizes of holes or slots.
- **Screen mesh**: The screen mesh will be used to cover the holes or slots in the plastic storage bin to prevent pests and insects from entering your compost bin. You will need a screen mesh that is fine enough to keep out unwanted visitors, but coarse enough to allow air and water to pass through. You can use any type of screen mesh that meets these criteria, such as window screen, hardware cloth, or chicken wire.
- **Scissors**: The scissors will be used to cut the screen mesh to fit the holes or slots in the plastic storage bin. You will need scissors that are sharp enough to cut through the screen mesh without damaging it.
- **Glue**: The glue will be used to attach the screen mesh to the plastic storage bin. You will need glue that is strong enough to hold the screen mesh in place and is waterproof and weather-resistant. You can use any type of glue that meets these criteria, such as hot glue, super glue, or epoxy.
- **Organic waste**: The organic waste will serve as the main ingredient for your compost bin. You will need enough organic waste to fill your plastic storage bin and provide a steady supply of compost. The organic waste can be any type of biodegradable material that comes from plants or animals, such as food scraps, yard trimmings, paper, etc.

## Steps for Making a DIY Compost Bin

1. Prepare the plastic storage bin. Use the drill to make holes or slots in the plastic storage bin for ventilation and drainage. Make sure to make holes or slots on all sides of the bin, including the lid and the bottom.

2. Prepare the screen mesh. Use the scissors to cut the screen mesh to fit the holes or slots in the plastic storage bin. Make sure to cut enough pieces of screen mesh for each hole or slot.

3. Attach the screen mesh to the plastic storage bin. Use the glue to attach the screen mesh pieces to the inside of the plastic storage bin over each hole or slot. Make sure to cover each hole or slot completely and securely.

4. Fill
the plastic storage bin with organic waste.
Use
a shovel or a scoop
to fill
the plastic storage bin with organic waste
through
the lid.
Make sure
to mix
different types of organic waste
together,
such as green materials (e.g., fruit peels, vegetable scraps, grass clippings, etc.) and brown materials (e.g., dry leaves, paper, cardboard, etc.). A good ratio
is
one part green materials
to
three parts brown materials.

5. Seal
the plastic storage bin with
the lid.
Make sure
the lid
is tight and secure.

6. Place
the compost bin in
a sunny location.
Choose
a location that receives plenty of sunlight
and has good drainage.
The sunlight will help heat up
the compost bin
and speed up
the composting process.

7. Wait for
the composting process
to start.
It may take several weeks or months for
the composting process
to start,
depending on
the type and amount of organic waste,
the temperature,
and other factors.
You will know when
the composting process
has started when you see
the organic waste shrink in volume,
smell an earthy odor,
and feel heat from
the compost bin.

8. Turn 
the compost regularly.
Use
a shovel or a fork
to turn 
the compost every few days or weeks
to aerate it and mix it evenly.
This will help speed up
the composting process
and prevent odors and pests.

9. Use
the compost for your desired purpose.
Use
a shovel or a scoop
to remove 
the compost from
the plastic storage bin when it is ready.
You can use
the compost for various purposes such as enriching your garden soil, fertilizing your plants, or making potting mix.

## How does it Work?

The compost bin works by breaking down organic waste inside 
the sealed chamber.
The organic waste is decomposed by 
microorganisms 
that live in 
the moist and warm environment.
This process produces compost as well as other byproducts such as heat, water, and carbon dioxide.

The compost is a nutrient-rich soil amendment that can improve the quality and fertility of your garden soil. It can also help retain moisture, suppress weeds, and prevent diseases. The other byproducts of 
the composting process, including heat, water, and carbon dioxide, can be beneficial for the environment and the plants as well.

## Benefits of Compost Bins

Compost bins offer many benefits, including:

- **Reducing waste**: By repurposing organic waste, compost bins help reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills, which helps keep our environment cleaner and safer.
- **Saving money**: By making your own compost, you can save money on buying fertilizers and soil amendments for your garden.
- **Improving soil**: By adding compost to your garden soil, you can improve its quality and fertility, as well as its ability to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and prevent diseases.
- **Enhancing plants**: By fertilizing your plants with compost, you can enhance their growth, health, and yield, as well as their resistance to pests and diseases.
- **Educating yourself**: By making your own compost, you can learn more about the natural cycle of life and the benefits of recycling and reusing resources.
