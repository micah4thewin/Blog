# Bicycle Powered Water Pump: A Comprehensive Guide

A bicycle powered water pump can be a great way to irrigate crops and gardens in remote communities and areas not connected to the public water system. It can also be used for small scale irrigation or other light tasks. This guide will take you through the basics of building a bicycle powered water pump and how it works. 

## What is a Bicycle Powered Water Pump?
 
A bicycle powered water pump is a device used to pump water using the power generated by a bicycle. It uses a modified bicycle, usually with a trailer attached, that is connected to a pump. As the cyclist pedals, the crank shaft turns, pushing the pump and allowing water to be sucked up from a nearby source and then released through a hose.

## Materials Needed

In order to build a bicycle powered water pump, you will need the following materials:

- **Bicycle**: The bicycle is the main component of the device that provides the power for pumping water. You can use any type of bicycle that has a crank shaft and pedals, but you may want to choose one that is sturdy and comfortable to ride.
- **Plywood**: The plywood is used to make the base of the trailer that will hold the pump and the pipes. You will need a piece of plywood that is large enough to fit your pump and pipes, as well as two tyres.
- **Tyres**: The tyres are used to attach the trailer to the bicycle and provide stability and mobility. You will need two tyres that are compatible with your bicycle and can fit on the plywood base.
- **Nuts & Bolts**: The nuts and bolts are used to secure the tyres to the plywood base and the pipe fittings to the trailer. You will need enough nuts and bolts of the appropriate size and shape for your materials.
- **Pipe Fittings**: The pipe fittings are used to connect the pipes to the trailer and the pump. You will need pipe fittings that match the diameter and shape of your pipes and pump, such as elbows, tees, couplings, etc.
- **PVC Pipe**: The PVC pipe is used to transport water from the source to the pump and from the pump to the hose. You will need enough PVC pipe of the appropriate diameter and length for your project.
- **Hose Clips**: The hose clips are used to attach the PVC pipe to the trailer and prevent it from moving or falling off. You will need enough hose clips of the appropriate size for your pipe.
- **Pump**: The pump is the device that sucks up water from the source and pushes it through the hose. You will need a pump that can be attached to your crank shaft and has enough power and capacity for your needs.
- **Couplings**: The couplings are used to connect
the pump
to
the pipe fittings. You will need couplings that match
the diameter and shape of your pump and pipe fittings.
- **Primer**: The primer is used
to prepare
the pipes and couplings before gluing them with PVC glue. It helps create a stronger bond between
the materials.
- **PVC Glue**: The PVC glue is used
to seal
the pipes and couplings together. It prevents leaks and ensures
a smooth flow of water.

## Steps for Building a Bicycle Powered Water Pump

1. Attach
the trailer
to
the bicycle. Measure and mark
the middle of
the plywood. Drill holes and insert
the tyres. Secure
the tyres
to
the plywood with
the bolts and nuts.

    * Use a tape measure or a ruler
to find
the center point of
your plywood base.
    * Use a pencil or a marker
to mark
the point where you want
to attach
your tyres.
    * Use a drill or a screwdriver
to make holes in
your plywood base where you marked.
    * Insert your tyres into
the holes and align them with your bicycle wheels.
    * Use nuts and bolts
to fasten your tyres onto your plywood base.

2. Connect
the pipe fittings
to
the trailer. Measure
the PVC pipe and cut it
to size. Attach
the PVC pipe
to
the trailer using hose clips.

    * Use pipe fittings such as elbows or tees 
to create a path for your PVC pipe from your water source 
to your pump 
and from your pump 
to your hose.
    * Use nuts and bolts 
to secure 
your pipe fittings 
to your trailer.
    * Use a tape measure or a ruler 
to measure 
how much PVC pipe you need 
for each section of your path.
    * Use a hacksaw or a pipe cutter 
to cut 
your PVC pipe 
to the required length.
    * Use hose clips 
to attach 
your PVC pipe 
to your trailer and pipe fittings.

3. Attach
the pump
to
the trailer. Connect
the couplings
to
the pipe fittings.

    * Use nuts and bolts 
to secure 
your pump 
to your trailer.
    * Use couplings 
to connect 
your pump 
to your pipe fittings on both ends.

4. Apply primer
to
the pipes and couplings before gluing with PVC glue. Allow
the glue
to dry before using
the bike powered water pump.

    * Use a brush or a cloth 
to apply primer 
to the ends of your pipes and couplings that will be glued together.
    * Wait for a few minutes until the primer dries.
    * Use a brush or a cloth 
to apply PVC glue 
to the same ends of your pipes and couplings.
    * Quickly join the pipes and couplings together and twist them slightly to ensure a tight fit.
    * Hold them in place for a few seconds until the glue sets.
    * Wait for at least an hour until the glue cures completely before using your bike powered water pump.

## How does it Work?

The bicycle powered water pump utilizes energy generated from the cyclist pedaling in order to pump water. As the cyclist pedals, a crank shaft converts the energy generated from pedaling into mechanical energy, driving the pump. The pump then draws water from a source and disperses it through the hose. 

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The main advantage of a bicycle powered water pump is that it can be used to irrigate land and pump water in remote or difficult to access areas without requiring electricity. Additionally, it is a cheap and simple solution requiring few materials and relatively little maintenance. 

The main disadvantage is that regardless of the cyclistâ€™s strength and speed, water pressure will remain the same. Additionally, the process is labor intensive and may experience strain from pedaling for extended periods of time.
