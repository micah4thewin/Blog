# Bicycle Powered Water Pump: A Comprehensive Guide

A bicycle powered water pump can be a great way to irrigate crops and gardens in remote communities and areas not connected to the public water system. It can also be used for small scale irrigation or other light tasks. This guide will take you through the basics of building a bicycle powered water pump and how it works. 

## What is a Bicycle Powered Water Pump?
 
A bicycle powered water pump is a device used to pump water using the power generated by a bicycle. It uses a modified bicycle, usually with a trailer attached, that is connected to a pump. As the cyclist pedals, the crank shaft turns, pushing the pump and allowing water to be sucked up from a nearby source and then released through a hose.

## Materials Needed

In order to build a bicycle powered water pump, you will need the following materials:

- Bicycle
- Plywood
- Tyres
- Nuts & Bolts
- Pipe Fittings 
- PVC Pipe
- Hose Clips
- Pump
- Couplings
- Primer
- PVC Glue 

## Steps for Building a Bicycle Powered Water Pump

1. Attach the trailer to the bicycle. Measure and mark the middle of the plywood. Drill holes and insert the tyres. Secure the tyres to the plywood with the bolts and nuts.

2. Connect the pipe fittings to the trailer. Measure the PVC pipe and cut it to size. Attach the PVC pipe to the trailer using hose clips. 

3. Attach the pump to the trailer. Connect the couplings to the pipe fittings. 

4. Apply primer to the pipes and couplings before gluing with PVC glue. Allow the glue to dry before using the bike powered water pump.

## How does it Work?

The bicycle powered water pump utilizes energy generated from the cyclist pedaling in order to pump water. As the cyclist pedals, a crank shaft converts the energy generated from pedaling into mechanical energy, driving the pump. The pump then draws water from a source and disperses it through the hose. 

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The main advantage of a bicycle powered water pump is that it can be used to irrigate land and pump water in remote or difficult to access areas without requiring electricity. Additionally, it is a cheap and simple solution requiring few materials and relatively little maintenance. 

The main disadvantage is that regardless of the cyclistâ€™s strength and speed, water pressure will remain the same. Additionally, the process is labor intensive and may experience strain from pedaling for extended periods of time.
