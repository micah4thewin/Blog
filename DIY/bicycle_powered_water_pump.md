## Materials and Tools

To make a bicycle powered water pump, you will need the following materials and tools:

- A bicycle trainer stand that can hold your bike in place and allow the rear wheel to spin freely. You can buy one or make one from scrap metal and wood.
- A water pump that can be attached to the bike stand and driven by the bike wheel. You can buy one or modify an electric water pump by removing the motor and exposing the shaft.
- A plastic shim or a metal plate to connect the pump to the bike stand.
- A hose or a pipe that can fit the outlet of the pump and carry the water to where you need it.
- A foot valve that can be attached to the other end of the hose or pipe and submerged in the water source. This will prevent the water from flowing back and help prime the pump.
- A drill, a saw, a hammer, a wrench, and some bolts and nuts.

## Steps

To make a bicycle powered water pump, you will need the following materials:

- A bike stand with a resistance wheel or a friction adjuster
- A rotary pump with a shaft and an outlet
- A hose or a pipe that fits the outlet of the pump
- A foot valve that fits the hose or pipe
- A water source such as a bucket, a tank or a pond
- Bolts, nuts, washers, clamps and fittings as needed
- A drill, a wrench, a screwdriver and pliers

Follow these steps to assemble your bicycle powered water pump:

1. Remove the resistance wheel or the friction adjuster from the bike stand. You will not need them for this project. However, keep the knob and the plate that hold them in place. You will use them to mount the pump on the stand.
2. Bend the two flaps on the plate flat so that they can support the pump. You can use pliers or a hammer to do this. Make sure that the plate is still attached to the knob and can move up and down.
3. Place the pump on the plate and align it with the bike wheel. The shaft of the pump should be parallel to the bike wheel and have some clearance from it. The outlet of the pump should face away from the bike wheel.
4. Drill two holes on the plate that match the holes on the base of the pump. Use a drill bit that is slightly larger than the bolts you will use to attach the pump to the plate.
5. Attach the pump to the plate with bolts, nuts and washers. Tighten them securely with a wrench and a screwdriver. Make sure that the pump is stable and does not wobble on the plate.
6. Connect a hose or a pipe to the outlet of the pump and secure it with a clamp or a fitting. You can use PEX pipe or PVC pipe for this purpose. The length of the hose or pipe depends on how far you want to transport the water from the source.
7. Attach a foot valve to the other end of the hose or pipe and submerge it in the water source. The foot valve prevents water from flowing back into the pump when you stop pedaling. Make sure that there is no air leak in the system by checking all the connections and seals.
8. Attach your bike to the stand and adjust the knob to raise or lower the pump until it touches the bike wheel with some pressure. You don't want it to be too loose or too tight, as this will affect the efficiency of your water pump.
9. Prime the pump by filling it with water through the outlet or by spinning the bike wheel until water comes out. This removes any air bubbles from inside the pump and ensures that it is ready to operate.
10. Start pedaling and enjoy your bicycle powered water pump! You can adjust your speed and resistance to control how much water you pump per minute.

## Pro Tips and Tricks

Here are some pro tips and tricks that can help you make your bicycle powered water pump better:

- To increase the flow rate of water, you can pedal faster or use a larger diameter hose or pipe. You can also use a valve on the outlet hose or pipe to control the flow rate.
- To increase the pressure of water, you can use a smaller diameter hose or pipe or add a pressure tank or a storage tank to your system. You can also use a pressure gauge to monitor the pressure level.
- To increase the durability of your device, you can use high-quality materials and tools, such as stainless steel pump, PEX pipe, and rubber hose. You can also protect your device from dust, moisture, and sunlight when not in use.
- To increase the versatility of your device, you can use different types of pumps for different purposes, such as centrifugal pumps, diaphragm pumps, or rope pumps. You can also use a bicycle generator to power other devices while you pedal, such as lights, radios, or phones.

## Different Types of Pumps and Configurations

There are different types of pumps and configurations that you can use for your bicycle powered water pump, depending on your needs and preferences. Here are some examples:

- Centrifugal pump: This is the most common type of pump that uses a rotating impeller to create a vacuum and move the water. You can attach this pump to the bike stand and drive it by the bike wheel, as shown in this guide[^1^][1]. You can also use a belt or a chain to connect the pump to the bike wheel or pedal.
- Axial flow pump: This is a type of pump that uses a propeller to push the water along the axis of the pipe. You can mount this pump on the bike frame or fork and submerge it in the water source. You can then pedal the bike to spin the propeller and pump the water[^2^][2].
- Mixed flow pump: This is a type of pump that combines the features of centrifugal and axial flow pumps. It uses a twisted impeller to create both radial and axial thrust on the water. You can mount this pump on the bike stand or frame and drive it by the bike wheel or pedal[^2^][2].
- Peripheral pump: This is a type of pump that uses a rotating disc with blades to create high pressure and low flow rate. You can mount this pump on the bike stand or frame and drive it by the bike wheel or pedal[^2^][2]. This pump is suitable for pumping water uphill or over long distances.
- Jet pump: This is a type of pump that uses a nozzle to create a jet of water that entrains more water from the source. You can mount this pump on the bike stand or frame and drive it by the bike wheel or pedal[^3^][3]. You can also use an electric motor or a solar panel to power this pump.
- Electromagnetic pump: This is a type of pump that uses an electric current and a magnetic field to move the water. You can mount this pump on the bike stand or frame and drive it by an electric generator that you can power by pedaling the bike[^3^][3]. This pump is suitable for pumping saltwater or other conductive fluids.
- Rope pump: This is a type of pump that uses a rope with washers or knots to lift water from a well or a tank. You can mount this pump on a wooden frame and drive it by a crank that you can attach to the bike wheel or pedal[^4^][4]. This pump is low-cost and easy to maintain.
