## Comprehensive Guide to Building a Root Cellar

A root cellar is a simple, inexpensive way to store root vegetables, fruit, and other food items for an extended period of time. Root cellars utilize the principle of using the temperature of the ground to keep items cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Stored properly, vegetables can last up to 6 months, while some fruit can last up to one year.

In this guide, we will go over all the steps necessary to build your own root cellar and get it suitable for storing food.

### Step 1: Choosing the Location
The most important part of building a root cellar is finding the right spot. This spot has to be away from direct sunlight, have several inches of soil cover, and be situated near a water source such as a well or cistern[^1^][1]. The space should also have ample room for shelving or crates to store the food items.

Ideally, the outside temperature will not dip below freezing in the winter as this can damage food stored in the cellar.

Once you have chosen your spot, you need to determine the size of the cellar. You can make it as large or small as you like, but you need to consider the amount of food you plan on storing and the types of containers you will use.

### Step 2: Preparing the Site
Now that you have determined the size and location of your root cellar, it’s time to start preparing the site.

If you’re building the cellar outdoors, you’ll have to clear the site of any vegetation such as trees, shrubs, and grass. You can do this by hand with a shovel and rake, or with a rototiller if you’re feeling ambitious.

Once you’ve cleared the site, you need to level the ground. A level surface is essential for keeping the cellar airtight, so use a long board and a level to make sure the ground is even.

### Step 3: Building the Structure
Now it’s time to construct the actual root cellar. The cellar should have a waterproof roof to keep out the elements, as well as a ground-level floor to help regulate the temperature inside. You can build the walls out of any material, but it’s best to construct a double-walled structure and fill the space in between the two walls with insulation[^2^][2].

When it comes to the entrance of the cellar, you should make sure it has a ramp so that it’s easy for you to get in and out. You should also make sure the door is insulated and fits snugly to keep out drafts and moisture. 

### Step 4: Sealing Off the Cellar
Once you’ve built the structure, it’s time to seal it off so that
the temperature is consistent inside. You can do this by using airtight seals such as plastic sheeting,
weatherstripping,
and caulk around
the edges. It’s also important
to make sure there are no cracks or gaps in
the walls or floor that cold air can get through.

### Step 5: Storing
the Food
Now that your root cellar is sealed off,
you need
to start storing
the food. Root vegetables such as potatoes,
carrots,
and onions should be stored in crates or baskets and placed at a consistent temperature[^3^][3].

Fruits should be stored on shelves with powdered or crystallized sulfur
to prevent them from rotting[^4^][4]. If you’re also planning on storing canned goods,
make sure
to store them in airtight containers so that they don’t spoil.

### Step 6: Ventilating
the Cellar
Now that
the food is stored,
you need
to make sure
the cellar is properly ventilated. You should install a few vents near
the top of
the wall
to allow air
to flow in and a fan or door
to let stale or humid air out. Make sure
the vents are sealed off
to keep out pests and drafts.

### Step 7: Regular Maintenance
The last step is
to make sure you keep your root cellar in good condition. This means periodically checking it for cracks,
pests,
mold,
and other issues,
and making sure
the temperature and humidity levels stay consistently within
the optimal range.

## Conclusion

Building a root cellar is a simple yet effective way to extend
the shelf life of your food. By following these steps,
you can have your root cellar ready
to store food items in no time and keep them fresh for months or even years.
