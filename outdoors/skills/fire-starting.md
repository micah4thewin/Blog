# Guide to Firestarting

## Introduction
Firestarting is an essential survival skill that can help you stay warm, cook food, purify water, and signal for help. In this guide, we will go over some basic techniques for starting a fire, including using a lighter, matches, and natural materials.

## Materials
- A lighter or matches
- Kindling (small, dry twigs)
- Fuel (larger pieces of wood)
- Dryer lint, cotton balls, or other fire starters
- Dry, fluffy material for a fire nest (such as dry grass, bark, or leaves)

### Finding Materials in Oregon and Washington
- Kindling: Pine needles, dried ferns, and small twigs can be found in forests and wooded areas.
- Fuel: Look for deadfall, logs, and branches that are off the ground and dry.
- Fire starters: Collect dryer lint, cotton balls, or other dry materials from your home, or look for natural materials such as dried grasses, leaves, or tree bark.
- Fire nest material: Look for dry grass, bark, or leaves that are not wet or damp.

## Techniques

### Using a Lighter or Matches
1. Collect your kindling and fuel.
2. Arrange the kindling in a teepee shape, leaving enough space in the center for the flame to catch.
3. Place the fire starter in the center of the kindling and ignite it using a lighter or matches.
4. Once the kindling has caught fire, add the fuel gradually to build the fire.

### Using Natural Materials
If you do not have a lighter or matches, you can use natural materials to start a fire.

#### Hand Drill
1. Collect a dry stick and a dry board.
2. Cut a notch in the board and create a small depression next to it.
3. Place the end of the stick in the depression and rotate it rapidly between your palms, while applying downward pressure.
4. The friction between the stick and the board will create heat and eventually ignite the sawdust produced by the friction.
5. Transfer the burning sawdust to a nest of dry, fluffy material and blow gently to ignite.

#### Fire Plow
1. Collect a dry stick and a dry board.
2. Cut a groove in the board and flatten the end of the stick.
3. Rub the flattened end of the stick back and forth along the groove, using the friction to create heat.
4. As with the hand drill method, transfer the burning sawdust to a nest of dry, fluffy material and blow gently to ignite.

#### Bow Drill
1. Collect a dry spindle, a dry board, a bow, and a cord.
2. Cut a notch in the board and create a small depression next to it.
3. Place the spindle in the depression and use the bow to rotate the spindle rapidly while applying downward pressure.
4. The friction between the spindle and the board will create heat and eventually ignite the sawdust produced by the friction.
5. Transfer the burning sawdust to a nest of dry, fluffy material and blow gently to ignite.

## Tips for Lighting Fires in Wet and Cold Environments
- Look for sheltered areas such as under trees, cliffs or overhangs, to protect your fire from rain and wind.
- Collect dry kindling and fuel from under branches, logs, and other natural shelters.
- Use a knife to scrape off the outer, wet bark of sticks and branches to reveal the dry wood underneath.
- Use a larger piece of wood as a base to keep your kindling off the ground.
- Use a reflector wall made from large rocks, logs, or even snow, to protect your fire and reflect heat back to you.
- Light your fire with a fire starter such as dryer lint, cotton balls, or other dry materials.
- Keep your fire going by adding kindling and fuel gradually and using a small fan or blowing gently on the fire.
- Use a metal container or rocks to create a fire pit to keep the fire contained and prevent it from spreading.
- Always put out your fire completely before leaving it by pouring water over it and stirring the ashes until they are cold to the touch.

## Building a Wood Stove or Firepit in a Shelter
Building a wood stove or firepit in a shelter is a great way to stay warm and cook food without filling the shelter with smoke. The basic principles of building a smokeless fire are to provide enough air flow to the fire, and to use a design that will allow the smoke to escape through a chimney or other vent.

### Materials
- Bricks or rocks (dry and sturdy)
- Metal grates or plates (for cooking surface)
- Metal pipe or tubing (for chimney)

### Design Concepts
- Start by building a base for your stove or firepit using bricks or rocks. Make sure the base is sturdy and level.
- Build the walls of your stove or firepit using bricks or rocks, leaving gaps for air flow.
- Place a metal grate or plate on top of the walls to create a cooking surface.
- If building a stove, add a metal pipe or tubing to the top of the stove to create a chimney. The chimney should be at least 2-3 feet tall and should extend above the shelter's roofline.
- If building a firepit, leave a gap in the wall opposite the shelter's entrance to allow smoke to escape. You can also add a chimney if desired.
- Test your stove or firepit by lighting a small fire and adjusting the airflow as needed to reduce smoke.
- When building your stove or firepit, choose materials that are dry and sturdy. In Oregon and Washington, you can find rocks and bricks in riverbeds, on beaches, or in other natural areas. You can also purchase metal grates or plates and metal pipe or tubing from hardware stores.
- Well-known designs for smokeless stoves include rocket stoves and gasifier stoves, both of which use a similar principle of creating a strong, hot flame that burns wood more efficiently and produces less smoke. These designs are widely used in developing countries where wood is the primary fuel source, and there are many tutorials available online for building your own smokeless stove using simple materials.

## Fire Safety
Starting a fire can be dangerous, especially in dry or windy conditions. Here are some tips to help you stay safe while building and maintaining your fire:

### Before You Start Your Fire
- Check the fire danger level in your area and make sure fires are allowed.
- Look for a safe location to build your fire, away from flammable materials such as dry grass, leaves, or branches.
- Clear a 10-foot area around your fire pit or stove, removing any debris or flammable materials.
- Keep a bucket of water, sand, or a shovel nearby to put out the fire if needed.

### While You Build Your Fire
- Build your fire in a designated fire ring or stove, or in a cleared area where fires are allowed.
- Use small pieces of dry kindling to start your fire and gradually add larger pieces of wood.
- Never use gasoline, kerosene, or other accelerants to start your fire.
- Never leave your fire unattended.

### While Your Fire is Burning
- Keep your fire at a manageable size, and never build it higher than the walls of your stove or fire pit.
- Never leave your fire unattended.
- Keep a bucket of water, sand, or a shovel nearby to put out the fire if needed.
- Never burn trash or other materials that produce toxic fumes.
- Do not cut down or damage live trees or vegetation for firewood.

### After Your Fire is Out
- Use a shovel to spread out the ashes and embers and make sure they are cool to the touch.
- Pour water over the ashes to ensure they are fully extinguished.
- Stir the ashes and embers with a stick to make sure they are fully extinguished.
- Check the area around your fire pit or stove for any remaining embers or hot spots.
- If possible, dismantle your fire ring or stove and scatter the ashes in the surrounding area.

Remember, it is your responsibility to ensure that your fire is safe and does not pose a risk to people, wildlife, or property. Be aware of local fire regulations and always follow fire safety guidelines.
