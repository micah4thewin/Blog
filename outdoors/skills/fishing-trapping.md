# Guide to Fish Trapping

## Introduction
Fish trapping is a great way to catch fish in a survival situation without the need for fishing gear or bait. In this guide, we will go over some basic techniques for building fish traps and finding bait.

## Materials
- A knife or sharp cutting tool
- A container for bait (such as a can or plastic bottle)
- Cordage (such as paracord or natural fibers)
- Natural materials for building the trap (such as branches, vines, or reeds)
- Rocks or other heavy objects for weighing down the trap

### Finding Bait
- Look for natural bait such as insects, worms, or small fish.
- Use scraps of food such as bread, meat, or cheese.

## Techniques
### Funnel Trap
1. Find several straight, sturdy sticks or branches and cut them to a length of about 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm). Sharpen the ends of the sticks to a point using a knife or cutting tool.
2. Create a funnel-shaped structure by leaning the sticks together in a cone shape, with the narrow end of the funnel facing inward. The wide end of the funnel should be open to allow fish to swim in.
3. Secure the sticks together with cordage, such as paracord or natural fibers, by weaving it in and out of the sticks to hold them in place. Make sure the structure is stable and will not fall apart when placed in water.
4. Bait the trap by placing the container of bait at the narrow end of the funnel. Good baits include bread, cheese, meat, or insects.
5. Place the trap in shallow water, such as a river, stream, or pond. Make sure the trap is secure and will not be carried away by the current. The wide end of the funnel should be facing downstream, where the current will carry the scent of the bait downstream and attract fish.
6. Wait for fish to swim into the trap, where they will be trapped and unable to escape. Check the trap regularly to see if you have caught any fish. If you do catch fish, remove them from the trap carefully and avoid touching any sharp spines or fins.

### Basket Trap
1. Find flexible branches, vines, or reeds and cut them to a length of about 3 to 6 feet (1 to 2 meters), depending on the size of the trap you want to make.
2. Bundle the branches together and weave them into a basket shape with a small opening at one end. To weave the basket, begin by tying together a few of the branches at one end, and then weaving the remaining branches around them, alternating over and under each time. The size of the basket opening should be small enough that fish cannot swim out once they have entered.
3. Use cordage, such as paracord or natural fibers, to secure the branches in place by tying them tightly together. Make sure the basket is strong enough to withstand the weight of the rocks you will use to weigh it down.
4. Place the container of bait inside the basket. Good baits include bread, cheese, meat, or insects.
5. Place the trap in shallow water, such as a river, stream, or pond. Make sure the trap is secure and will not be carried away by the current. Weigh down the trap with rocks or other heavy objects to keep it in place.
6. Wait for fish to swim into the basket, where they will be trapped and unable to escape. Check the trap regularly to see if you have caught any fish. If you do catch fish, remove them from the trap carefully and avoid touching any sharp spines or fins.

## Conclusion
Fish trapping can be an effective way to catch fish in a survival situation. Remember to choose a good location for your trap, use natural materials to build it, and find suitable bait. Always be aware of local regulations and restrictions, and never take more fish than you need.
