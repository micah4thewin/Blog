### Signalling for Rescue

If you find yourself in a survival situation, it's important to know how to signal for rescue. Here are some tips to help you signal for rescue and increase your chances of being found:

1. Use a Signal Mirror:
A signal mirror is a small, lightweight mirror that can be used to reflect sunlight and signal for rescue. Hold the mirror up to your face and align it with the target you want to signal. Then, flash the mirror towards the target, making sure to keep the flash on target for several seconds. Repeat this process several times, as rescue personnel may be scanning the area for brief flashes of light.

2. Light a Signal Fire:
A signal fire is a large, smoky fire that can be used to signal for rescue. Build a fire using dry wood and tinder, and make it as large as possible. Once the fire is burning well, add green vegetation to create a lot of smoke. This will make the fire more visible from a distance.

3. Use Brightly Coloured Material:
Brightly coloured material such as a tarp, clothing, or a bright bandana can be used to signal for rescue. Hang the material from a high point or wave it back and forth to create movement. This will make it more visible from a distance.

4. Use an Emergency Whistle:
An emergency whistle is a small, lightweight whistle that can be used to signal for rescue. Blow the whistle in three short bursts, followed by a pause, and then repeat. This is the universal distress signal and will alert rescue personnel that you need help.

5. Create a Ground-to-Air Signal:
If you're unable to move from your location, create a large signal on the ground using rocks, logs, or other natural materials. Create the signal in an open area that can be seen from the air. This could be an "SOS" symbol or a large "X".

Remember to stay calm and use all available resources to signal for rescue. Be creative and try different methods until you are successful. With practice, you can become proficient at signalling for rescue and increase your chances of being found.
